I was with my girl at Sarit decided to have lunch at am Mexican place, called Fonda Tequeira. So I order my meal and and some drinks. They take their sweet time preparing my order and I assume the quality must be worth it. Kidogo kidogo a family of whites come buy and 2 waiters rush in and quickly take their order literally 10 mins go by and they have their meal. The tipping point was when a white guy come along sits next to us orders take out and in 10 mins his order is ready. At this point am like wtf I call the waitress and ask what’s up with my up order cause it’s like 20 mins I’ve haven’t received anything yet! She shows zero fucks and I ask her what’s going with my orders and the fact that I was there first and yet received no service. She looks me dead in my face and says I have to be patient. I ask her why even though i ordered first and she walks away. I tell my girl fuck this shit and we leave.

&#x200B;

We have become comfortable with each other and they chat with me while they are doing the housework. They explained that they prefer working together because they face sexual harassment from some men when they go to their houses alone. One of them told me a guy demanded oral sex from her and even tried to withhold payment if she refused. I was outraged by this and lately I  actually pay them more. 

&#x200B;

Get a sex worker if you want sexual services. Get a Mama Fua if you want laundry and cleaning services.

wrdvyb,Kenya,1660810818.0,"I was arrested yesterday at Globe Roundabout. They suspected me of being in possession of weed, which I was. The 4 officers(in civilian clothing) wanted to search me and I knew I was fucked. But your guy knows the constitution.

 1. You have the right to privacy, which means you can refuse to be searched.
2. If arrested, the police officer should identify him/herself and give a valid reason for arrest.

I used this knowledge and my Zeus-level confidence to gain power over the officers. If you've ever been arrested before, you know that the police often use intimidation tactics to scare you. So they put me in chains and threatened to take me to Central.

 ""Tukikupata na bangi ata moja kijana, utajua."" 
""Mimi sivutangi io vitu, nipeleke station tuambiane na wakubwa wenyu""

We eventually get to Central, and the officers ask me to stop. 

""Kijana toa bangi""
""Nawaambia sina bangi, kwanini tumesimama, situingie""

The officers take me to their store room or something and continue with the threats. My heart was beating hard af but I ain't no b***h. I was willing to call their bluff.

One of the officers suggests, ""Huyu tumpeleke kwa mkubwa."" So they call the ""mkubwa,"" who tells them to bring me in. Luckily, the mkubwa is a cool lady. I tell her my situation, that I was arrested and the police tried to violate my rights. After a lengthy conversation they realized I knew the law and I was finally released. I also used this line to play with their minds, ""Kama ningekuwa na bangi, singeitikia wanilete station, tungemalizana kwa barabara."" Worked like a charm😂

You should have seen me walking through the Central corridor, with a bag of weed in my pockets. You remember that scene in infinity war where thanos gets all infinity stones. I could feel myself powering up(from the power I just absorbed from the officers) I AM INEVITABLE

Anyways, I am typing this high as f***. Mimi si mjeuri officer, I was just trying to survive.

15outvw,Kenya,1691814881.0,"A few weeks ago I made a post about a certain girl I had a crush on and wanted to call and ask for a date.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/15c1p6j/how_am_i_going_to_get_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=1

Most of you said I should move on and stop simping, well, I did. Just a few days later, after morning classes I was going to my friend's place to chill with them as I waited for afternoon classes. I was walking and saw her like a few metres ahead, I called her and told her to slow down so we can walk together, she stays close to my friends'. 

With all your comments in mind, I absolutely had no intention of asking her out or anything. We just had a casual chat, about school, studies, life. Since I had no intention of impressing her I was really calm, the normal me, unlike how I stated in the post that conversations with her felt awkward.

It was through the small talk that I learned she won't be in school next semester, and it will be my last semester. Exams were about to start, meaning very few classes and chances of meeting her again were really slim, I was like well, my guy, this is your one and only time.

We were about to part ways and I had to come clean to her. I mentioned that I really thought I liked her, but, quote on quote from a comment I got, desire can't be negotiated. I told her she was really pretty, which she is, and for someone I only know by their first name and nothing else, she crosses my mind an unhealthy number of times. Note that I only told her this just to get it off my mind and not to pursue her. Because honestly, alikuwa amenimaliza na sio uongo. I genuinely felt like I loved her, yet I didn't even know her. Most of you (Male mostly ) can attest, being in a relationship is one thing, but being in love, very different. It was like the third time I was in love in my entire 20+ years of existence. 

Anyway, we part ways, after telling her that the discussion we just had never happened, and if she ever saw me in school she should just ignore me. I really hoped I never bumped into her again. Woo, I felt lighter. Few hours later, I got a whatsapp message ""Were you honest about what you said earlier?"" I figured it was her. I tried to stall and ignore her but after a second message from her I replied.

From that day we have been talking almost daily, the vibes are really on point . Apparently she was just shy and the thought of her texting someone first seemed off (women☕) And also,I said on a comment in the linked post that I found her staring at me a couple of times,she said that it was a way of grabbing my attention and she really hoped I could go over and talk to her (women again☕) Anyway, anytime in the past two weeks that we are both in school, we always hang out. This week we didn't meet much because it was exams week, but we both really longed to see each other at the end of the week.

Yesterday, she came over to my place, made her dinner, I really can't believe it is real, haha. She is currently dead asleep by my side (I guess that is what collecting four fire rounds back to back does to someone)

rxb663,Kenya,1641463914.0,"Long post ahead

So, yesterday, i went grocery shopping a bit late and got home at around 7. The main entrance to our apartment was locked, and i neighbor is outside the gate waiting for someone to come to his aid. I make fun of his situation & open the gate as i head to my house. Our appartment isn't big , so even though i hardly know anyone by name... I have lived in the same house and building for two years so i know my neighbors faces. This guy in particular, i had spoken to, just the usual greetings, trying to be a friendly neighbor, a couple of times. So the guy thanks me for letting him in, and proposes that he comes to my place for dinner. Naturally, i am an introvert, i rarely have people in my house, but part of my new year resolution is to be more friendly & meet new people. This is my neighbor, he lives a floor below me & i literally have to pass by his apartment every time i have to go in & out of the apartment building. He has been living in the apartment for over an year, he seems harmless enough so i agree.
I head to my house, prepare my meal & its around 9 when i am done. I don't have his number so i decide to wait for a few minutes to see if he will show up or not. about 10 minutes later, he shows up. with him there i take the necessary precautions i usually take while hanging out with new people. I text my sister his details and don't lock the door. I am not about to lock a stranger in the house with myself. I put on a movie which i love and serve us food. We eat, he is great company. 
We finish eating we finish up the movie while making small talk here and there.
Like an hour in, the guy turns to me & says i have something to tell you, i am like ok, go on. The guy says he has seen me around for the past year & he likes me. I give an awkward ""ok"" he proceeds to ask, so what are we going to do about it. I respond, ""nothing, I don't know you."" He insists that i know him we live in the same apartment, he literally lives in the apartment below me. I tell him that is not enough information for me to consider it knowing a person. He insists that i know him. I insist that i dont. At this point its getting weird so i say i am sleepy it is time for him to leave. The guy says he will not leave without a kiss. I insist no. He asks why. I say I don't want to. Plus i am in a relationship. This guy lives next to the apartment entrance, i am a hundred percent sure he has seen me & my boyfriend coming in & out of the appartment severally. I insist that i would never do anything to jeopardize my relationship. He tells me my boyfriend is not around so he won't know. I affirm that i will know, kissing him is wrong whether my boyfriend knows or not so i will not do it. This guy will not take a no for an answer. So i suggest, i will give him a peck or maybe a kiss when he is at the door on his way out. My thought process is when he is up,i will push him out & lock the door. The guy refuses, he insists that i must give him s kiss there, on the sofa. I insist i won't. 
At this point i just want the guy to leave my house. Two things you need to know, i am petite & i live in a studio apartment. So this guy at this point carries me to my bed and gets on top of me. I am freaking out at this point. I am pushing him away but he is not having it. Compared to him...i have no chance. I am kicking, shoving, shaking my whole body. He is not having it. I am shouting at this point. He is telling me to relax as he forcibly tries to push his fingers through my short. I am wiggling around & making the whole thing so difficult. I ask the guy ""what do you think you are doing?"" At this point i am frustrated. I have told him multiple times to get off me. He is not bulging. I have told him countless times that i do not want to do whatever he want, he is not bulging. The guy replies that we are having sex. I tell him this is not sex, he is trying to rape me. The guy does not bulge. Rather, he seems frustrated with my continued refusal and puts one of his hand on my neck. At this point i am scared shitless. I literally think this is how i am going to die. He pins me down. At this point in my head all i can think of is the last thing that would happen to me in my life is have someone rape me in my own home. I would rather die.
I try reaching around but the only thing i can reach is a pillow, that wont do any damage. I am scared, he is almost getting through my shorts. So i decide it a do or die situation. He was so focused on getting my short off that he was not paying attention on the hand on my neck. I manage to bite him. He gets it off. I tell him to get off me or i will scream. Remember the door is open. This scares him, he gets of me. I tell him to get out of my house. He scatters. At the door he has the audacity to say ""see you tomorrow"".
I get back in the house & lock the door. I am scared. My neck is sore. I can feel some pain on my shoulder. I cant believe what just happened. I am staring at the celling for hours trying to digest the whole thing. Its 4am the next time i check the clock. I haven't slept at all. Every small movement frightens me. What if he tries to break into my house & tries it again. I finally drift off.
I am awake again at 6am.
I cant even bring myself to believe what happened. I am a bit calmer now so i can think rationally. I wonder what the guys thought process was. Why would anyone want to rape a neighbor knowing very well that we would see each other every day. I can identify him to the police.
I think about reporting the case, but what would i say. I live in Kenya. Just like most African countries, rape cases here are not given the seriousness it deserves. Attempted rape cases are even worse in this case. What would i even say. Would anyone believe me? People would think i asked for it simply because i let the guy in my house at night. If i reported it, i literally had zero evidence of the whole thing, i don't know if neighbors had the exchange. If anyone had, I don't understand why anyone wouldn't come to my aid. I feel broken. A bit lost. I just don't understand what i did wrong. Even if the penetration did not happen, i kinda understand why people do not report such cases. 
I called my sister in the morning & told her what happened. I am still scared. I still have to see this guy every day. I want to tell my boyfriend but i don't know how he will react, he is unpredictable. I want to forget the whole thing but i don't know how. For F**ksake, i have been locked up in my house the whole day. I know i need to get out at some point.

I don't know how to deal with the whole thing. I remember the face the guy had when i made it clear that what he was trying to do was rape. He wasn't shocked. That is what scared me the most. Clearly he has done this before, he probably might do it again. & That is what breaks my heart the most. I like to think i am strong & independent but never have i ever felt so weak in my life. I can't even bring myself to expose his face. I don't know how to deal honestly. Psychologically i am a mess. So much for meeting new people this year..




UPDATE
I HAVE REPORTED THE CASE TO THE POLICE. HE ADMITTED WHAT HE DID, SO THAT GIVES ME A BIT OF PEACE. THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR YOUR SUPPORT & ADVICE, IT REALLY GAVE ME THE STRENGTH I NEEDED. I HAVE ALSO SHARED MY EXPERIENCE WITH MY BOYFRIEND & FAMILY. THANK YOU EVERY ONE.

FINAL UPDATE....After i reported the case to the police, the guy was arrested & spent the night in a police cell. Looking back at the whole thing, i admit that i did make some wrong calls along the way but even so, that does not give anyone the right to force themselves on me. All i wanted from the situation was for the guy to know what he did was wrong. That actions have consequences so that in future, he understands that if & when he choses to engage in any form of sexual contact, both parties should be in agreement. I made the personal decision not to take the case to court but rather, have the guy experience some form consequences for his actions. The guy will be moving out of the appartment. Also, he has to make weekly visits to the police station for assessment & punishment. Hopefully, he learns from this experience.
I want to thank all of you for the kind words & support & thank the very good ladies at the sexual and gbv office at the police station i reported the case at. At no point during my interaction with them did i feel judged. They were very helpful & understanding. All i can do now is try & put this situation behind me and move on. Lessons were learnt. I am no way close to recovery, but i will definitely be taking it one day at a time...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/rxb663/almost_got_raped_yesterday/,Almost got raped yesterday,,219,154,0.97

14gv5lt,Kenya,1687516748.0,"...but I'm glad it's over.

I joined what I thought was a routine global zoom call yesterday (Thursday, 06-22-023) & got notified that everyone on the call had been terminated.  All our access codes & clearances were disabled. The organization is folding its E.Africa operations. We had 3 hours to clear our desks and be out of the premises. It's humbling carrying a ka box with your belongings through the corridors.


I joined the organization as a Finance Intern in 2013 and have risen through the ranks over the years. I had a salary of about 230K (including allowances) that has allowed me to invest modestly. I'm an introvert and mostly lead a frugal lifestyle. I only splurge on a monthly  brunch/spa date with my cousin who's also my only friend. I drink on occasion. I'm currently single and childless. My last relationship ended during the pandemic & I just retreated into work.


 I have zero debt. I own a rental flat  in the city outskirts, 7 Ibr units and three 2br units. I live in one of the 2br units. I have driven the same car since 2016(Toyota Premio). I have a decent MMF portfolio with two different firms. I have also invested in long term government bonds. I own a salon on the basement of my flat. In total I have an average income of about 180k pm from my investments. I have solid savings & an emergency fund. I'm getting a substantial sum for my gratuity as well.

 My immediate plan is to retrain my salon staff as I intend to expand to include new services. Meanwhile,I'm going away for a one month holiday. I've never been on an actual vacation apart from those work trips at the coast. My job was toxic but I preserved for the bag & it's paid off. I doubt I'm going back to formal employment any time soon. I'm free, but also a little nostalgic about some aspects of the job.

EDIT:

The salary mentioned is my net. I worked for an international firm, the per diems alone were CRAZY even as an Intern. You'd go to conduct some trainings huko mashimani counties for six months and the per diem would be enough to purchase a small asset. That's how I bought my car, didn't touch my savings. I didn't mention other benefits like a fuel card etc.

 I had access to an affordable inhouse mortgage scheme that I used to finance the building in addition to the savings I had at the time. Paid it all off. It took me over 4 years to complete building. 

I save every cent I can and minimize my expenditure. I have no luxuries. I'm also not selling anything. Just a boring chic who's maintained financial discipline & had the luck of a good income.

My account is over 2 years old, I've never posted anything before though. This is my story, I just wanted to share it and exhale.

EDIT:
I've replied to a few comments and added clarifications in the main post. The comments are becoming a bit toxic, I think I'll stop now. There's no catch guys. Nilifutwa kazi na yes I tried kujipanga over the years and it's paid off.

EDIT: Someone said they thought I have seven 1 bedroom flats and three 2br flats🤣 Maybe my wording in the main post is off. Ni flat Moja yenye Iko na 10 units. Of those ten units, Saba ni 1br na tatu ni 2br.

13tv2n0,Kenya,1685262261.0,"I always wonder why my experiences are different from the guys who post here...

I have dated 4 girls since high school. Two of them when I didn't have any money. I never took them to a date. I only heard in this subreddit that people go on dates that cost 4k and above. 

My current gf and I live an average lifestyle. She is a maid and I am a fundi.

For some context I live in a poor neighborhood in naivasha. All the men I work with have girlfriends and even wives. Even the guy who brings us food has a girlfriend.

 So when you guys say all women love money it doesn't make sense to me. 

90% of women in Kenya are married to men who make less than 50k a month. Most men here make less than 30k if that.

I have seen all kinds of guys who had a partner. Disabled men, poor men, ugly men.

I have also seen all kinds of women get married. Disabled women, poor women, ugly women. 
There is someone for everyone. 

And the topic of single mothers. If a foreigner saw this subreddit, they would think no one wants single mothers. Reality is they get married in real life here in Kenya. 

The same way they would think that Kenyan society is a woke irreligious one where even LGBTQ community is tolerated. Reality is Kenya is a very religious society. 95% of Kenyans don't support the LGBTQ. 

Anyway whenever I see misogyny in this subreddit I always conclude that this subreddit doesn't represent Kenyan society. I don't even bother replying to those comments. Maybe some guys here are incels or don't know how to form a genuine romantic relationship. Maybe some of the posts are not genuine.

Maybe most of you guys live in the richer parts of Nairobi. Maybe the women who live there have very high standards.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/13tv2n0/what_kind_of_women_are_you_guys_dating/,What kind of women are you guys dating?,Ask r/kenya,210,206,0.93

Given everything that happened in my life I never even once imagined making it to 20.
At 17 I was diagnosed with cancer, leukemia and the odds weren’t good, and the only reason it was caught was because I attempted to OD.
~
At 18 1/2 It Finally went in remission and last month marked 3 years of me being in remission…so 2 more years and I will be cancer free (if it remains in remission)
~
When I think of everything I have been able to achieve and accomplish up to now, it just seems a bit surreal
~
The first couple of months when I was diagnosed I was numb and then I was scared and then I realized that I did not in fact want to die (reminded me of a book called “Veronica Must Die”) and I had a therapist I was working with and they suggested I make a “Bucket List” and try to do as many as I can….I couldn’t think of a single thing I wanted to do…I did want to visit that library in Switzerland that that boy and girl from “The fault in our star” visited but It was supposed to be with my best friend who unfortunately died from suicide a couple of weeks prior to my diagnosis.
~
One thing I can say is taken for granted is having a good bill of health…..I have always been the sick child, when I was born I had to be incubated and undergo a few surgeries just to keep me alive….I do not know what it means to not feel or be sick😅
And so when the cancer diagnosis came in I knew for a fact that I wouldn’t make it.

So here’s to reaching 21 and hopefully beating cancer at 23.

Even though i find clubs to be one giant cesspool, i went and that made it to the list of bad decisions i've made in life. I quite literally got bitten.

This was the order of events;

A friend invites me to join him at the afterparty of some event, but they were pregaming at the club first. I say okay, i'll join you at the club but i can't go for the party, I have to go home early. I make sure everything's in order at home, cleaned up, cooked supper, then hit my mum with the 'acha niende hivi nacome' Soon as i'm out of the house i set an alarm for two hours later(this will be important later on) And, i'm wearing sweatpants( also important later).

So i go, meet this guy (lets call him Z ), he's there with his friends and he introduces me as 'his woman'. I'm surprised yes, but i decide to go along with it because it's all in good fun, right? Wrong. Anyways, it was fun, got along pretty well with the people at the table, some nice 'shouting over the music' conversations, it's all good. A few hours in some lady(let's call her ""Cardi WannaB"") shows up out of nowhere, grabs Z by the hand and leads him sijui where. Some questioning looks around the table and i'm not sure how to feel about this...So i go to the washroom.

Coming back, i find Cardi WannaB at the table and Z introduces us. Again he introdues me as his girl and her as his sister..or at least that's what i heard. At this point everyone is looking at us, and i sense some underlying BS. I smile, say hi and extend my hand and she gives me the most off-ish greeting then turns to Z and starts going off on him. In my head i'm thinking okay this is my cue i should leave before things get messy. By good grace, my alarm goes of and i act like it was a phonecall. I go back to the table, telll everyone it was nice to meet them but i have to leave.A few pleas of 'oooh dont gooo'. Sijui shida ya walevi na kuacha watu waende home hukua gani.  😂

Sasa Z decides to follow me, asking me not to leave mara it's not what you think. The girl is steady behind him. I stop in the parking lot to tell them it's all good but Cardi WannaB has other plans. She's like 'acha aende' then pushes me. Ugh. I take a good look at her in her little skirt , 50 inch stick ons and faux lashes that could be used as umbrellas and decide it's not worth it. Nikamwambia 'Mami, sijui shida yako na mimi ni gani but i'm leaving anyway so you relax and have fun' I walk away smiling thinking how i handled that shit with grace.

Weh, no sooner had i taken two steps than this B-word pulls my hair. Then she starts doing some catfight moves on me. I get enraged, i think if it's a fight you want, a fight you shall get. One good push and she's on the ground, i'm on top of her and give her square punches on the face, making sure Cardi WannaB goes home with two black eyes. The whole world had disappeared it was just me and this little B-word and i was taking out all my rage on her. The whole time i'm thinking 'where did i even learn to fight'

Eventually, i'm pulled of her, and during this process, she gives me one good bite on the thigh, hadi i started bleeding, mind you i'm in sweatpants. I noticed there was a crowd gathered around, and Z was standing there in shock. I get up compose myself and the girl is dragged away. People ask why we were fighting and even I  have no idea. I continue with my journey home, Z still following me, and mind you it's drizzling. I didn't sign up for this telemundo bs. I told him i'm good, we'll talk, go check on your 'sister'. Sister kumbe ashaa amka and she's coming my way. Did this woman have a deathwish? In a good turn of events, Z's friends who had witnessed some part of this, start going off on her, telling her things like ata avae nini she can't match up . I'm confused, first of all, kwani si sister? Second, these people have no idea who i am, match up aje sasa.

Anyways, I take advantage of the ongoing chaos and make my way home once again.

Now here i am, with some deep bite marks on my thigh, reading horror stories of people who died or contacted some weird shit from human bites. And i still have no idea why she came at me in the first place.

Anyways, on Tuesday I found out I was pregnant. It was very unexpected. For the past week I had been feeling nauseated and thought I had gut issues which I rarely have as I try to eat healthy. I was at a salon getting my hair and nails done so I went to withdraw some money at the chemist and we got talking with the kind lady. Long story short, she did a pregnancy test for me which turned out positive and as a 26 year old who is very child free, it was a surreal feeling. 

I went through a myriad of emotions to say the least. Anxiety, happiness, sadness and so on. I thought about the life within me and I felt like it would be a son and I was so happy for that but then again I don't want to be any one's parent atleast not under the circumstances this baby was conceived... Why would I willingly be a single mother? Why would I traumatize my child with questions about who his father is? So I made up my mind and there's no turning back. 

I know everyone's opinion on abortion is different but in my time of need, I am glad that I had the privilege to access such an essential service because it is healthcare. May God forgive me and make it easier for me.

Edit 1:  I didn't want to say that I was assaulted because that would make y'all sympathetic for me but oh boy are you lot evil. People in my DMS wishing me death really? Was it that serious? Anyways I'm doing good actually and if that hurts you so be it. I'm peaceful and happy in my decision and I am in no pain. To the ones wishing me death, don't worry, I've wished to die since I was attacked. Anyways cheers!

I met this young dark-skinned lady two weeks ago. And as a light-skinned man, I like and fall for women with dark skin tones. I tried to avoid her the first week, but she was all in my business & even tried to hit on me. I gave her my contact we started vibing and even planned to go for a date this coming Sunday. Before we hit it off, I asked her if she was in a serious relationship or in a situationship, but she dodged my question the entire day. I went to her the next day and posed the same question, and she confidently told me, “Yes*, I am seeing someone, but I want you. I want you to fight and compete with the other guy, and I will choose who I want*”. I abruptly told her I was too old for that shit. I do not compete for women because other important places in life need my energy and focus.

She is in shock and mad ‘cause I refused to pursue her and canceled the date! Chasing a woman who is in a relationship is not worth it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/14a2p7p/zero_bullshit_while_dating_in_your_30s/,Zero Bullshit While Dating In Your 30s!,Discussion,187,159,0.97

150c2sq,Kenya,1689427698.0,"My name is Jane Njambi from Thika Kenya. I work from home and help small business owners with **Digital Marketing** and **Web-Design**.  


I hold a BA in Community Development. I graduated in 2016 and couldn't secure a job so I turned to the internet and started doing affiliate marketing. I was surprised when I made $664 in just 11 days and from that moment I decided to stick to the internet.  


I run a youtube channel where I teach people different things they can do online. I have done a variety like dropshipping products from aliexpress but the business did not go so well. I have shipped products from china through alibaba to Kenya and sold them online through my website. I have been scammed by these chinese but I learned how not to be frustrated by them.i have sold pegs for my mom on Jumia that she was sourcing from Kamukunji and made sales then operated at a loss because of listing them in a category where shipping was the same  price of the product without knowing I was doing the wrong thing.  


You see not giving up and learning new things is the best thing I have experienced. I blog too and everything that I know I learned online.  


If you want to learn new skills for free go to 

* YouTube,
* skillshare(free trial) 
* LinkedIn learning (free trial)

From these sites you can learn anything. Then list your skills on either your website,**fiverr** or **upwork**. Then from there advertise yourself with *google ads,FB ads , email marketing and native advertising*.   


**Here are some things you can do from home and generate revenue either part-time or full-time**  


1. **Teach what you are good at** \- This is done best by creating online courses. Record yourself or your computer screen. Create a course of like 6 hours Then post these videos  on sites like teachable,udemy, LinkedIn learning,skillshare and that way you will start having students enroll. I host my online school where I teach affiliate marketing on thinkific. I like it coz payment is instant and I pay commission to no one. 
2. **Social media support** \- most companies are selling online. Reach out to them and let them know you can respond to their customer questions on their Facebook inbox, WhatsApp, instagram, twitter. To also attract more customers you can have a simple website that will cost you like $50 to construct and drive traffic to it through ads and let potential clients book appointments with you. Avoid face to face meetings they are a waste of time. Instead do zoom meetings
3. **Blog** \- Do not under estimate blogging there are people making a sustainable income from it. Create a simple blog with WordPress . Write articles of what you are good at. At first you will not be monitized by adsense,ezoic or any other company you familiar with but guess what you can add affiliate links to your blog posts and generate very good income. The best affiliate company I use is CJ affiliate they give nice commissions
4. **Youtube** \- create videos of anything, to make money with these videos add affiliate links on the description. I created my YouTube channel back in 2017 reviewed a program and added affiliate link of their course that I was recommending in one month I had made $1000 in commission from the video and it had not even reached 500 views. Also I run ads and recommended my course and out of $2.50 I spent on youtube discovery ad I would make 2-4 sales a day and my course was costing $11.99. you don't need a good camera for youtube your phone is enough,your computer screen is enough
5. **Sell products online** \- you can sell products on Jumia,jiji,kilimall or your own website. The easiest place I got a sale was actually Jumia. If you want to sell on your own website run ads they bring customers very quickly. Another thing source products from kamukunji or eastleigh and if you want them customized/private label turn to alibaba  


Don't sit back and say there are no jobs convert your skill to an opportunity that makes you money.

vr3uxv,Kenya,1656928449.0,"20s can be the pits! Been there. Its like getting lost in an alien forest in an uninhabited alien world. But never give up. Here is my story - perhaps it can help someone out there who is losing all hope.

My story: I was supposed to graduate from uni in 2008, but i got suspended, and ended up graduating 3 yrs later in 2010. Then my father refused to pay my uni fees and living expenses, and left home to chase skirts with gratuity money. I found a job in a cyber. Back then surfing the internet using airtime was too expensive so everyone went to cybers. My mom really helped me out. Cleared my fees and supported me until i graduated. But when you have studied law, graduating out of uni is nothing. You cannot be employed unless as a clerk. You must go to Kenya School of Law for 1 year, then pupillage for 6 months, get admitted, then get employed as the lowest ranking ""punda"" in a law firm. KSL fees had doubled from 45k, to 90k then 190k, then add living expenses. KSL easily meant you spending not less than 300k.

We didn't have 300k let alone 190k fees. So i stayed at home as my uni classmates, finished KSL, got jobs in law firms, ODPP, judiciary, NGOs and what not. I could not face anyone. Sent applications everywhere but everyone wanted a lawyer who has been admitted to the bar. I became a shamba boy helping my mom feed cows, planting cabbages, going barefoot to cut napier grass for the cows etc. I would rarely leave our farm lest be seen by neighbors and provide the week's gossip. 

I hit the lowest of low but i never sank to drinking or drugs or fapping or contemplated suicide. aAll my boxers were so old, but i had no money to buy new ones and i could not ask my mom. Did not want to burden her more. The manual/physical farm labour kept my mind and body busy. I would work on the farm even when its raining unless the rain became hard, until darkness forced me to call it a day. The next day, the same thing. 

By sheer luck, we got some kiasi windfall and by then, i had given up on law altogether and resolved to do business or something else but not law. That lady convinced me to go back to KSL and finish, get admitted and then come back and pursue whatever i wanted. I did not want to but i listened. Went back to KSL in 2013 (5 yrs after my uni classmates), a month late after reporting date. So much was alien in the legal field, new constitution, new land laws, new police laws etc. Threw myself so hard at studies from Feb to Dec, sleeping only 4-6 hrs during that time. 

Hard work saved me. Life totally changed after KSL. I am can't believe that i am living a life that i could not even dare dream of. So chin up and grind on, or hang in there. The best is yet to come.

And oh, in 2011-12, I lived in Majengo slums where when i wanted to go and eat or buy from a shp, i carried only 50/- or 100/- and my ID. In case cops stopped me, my would show them my ID, in case thugs stopped me, they will only steal the 50/- or 100/-. My body would take a whole week without doing a number 2 because the toilets where i stayed were... wacha tu! On sundays, i would go to a new toilet at Gikosh and pay 20/- and stay inside for 1 hr, just enjoying how a clean toilet is.

I still recall those days and believe that nothing will ever faze me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/vr3uxv/the_20s_can_be_the_pits_but/,The 20s can be the pits but..,,179,33,0.99

13mnjho,Kenya,1684576044.0,"My dad stayed. He's been there my whole life.
We have slept hungry more times than I can count. Not because he's jobless, he just preferred alcohol and women to feeding us. 
We are his last priority. Even when fees was 1000 a year, he still didn't pay. But you'd see him with new shoes and clothes. 
We started getting older and noticing his infidelity. As kids we just thought money was tight and didn't mind. But you get older and it's pretty obvious. 

When we got to our teens he completely let go. Rent he didn't even try. Previously we've been kicked out of houses like thrice but he at least paid 3 times a year or so. We got older and we had to start hustling fast. 

He encouraged as to get boyfriends to get some money. So you get 500 for fare, 200 you spend on fare and 300 you buy food for the family. He was very comfortable. 

He discouraged us from being tied to one man and play men for money. When my sister confronted him about one of his affairs while we had no food he said ""how can you talk about this girl, you push with married men too"". 

Now we've moved out and he's become those village drunks pushing with girls everywhere. My mom is still complaining, idk why. My sister amepotea kabisa and when you try to talk to her she says ""I'm my father's daughter"". 

If your father left, don't feel too bad. You might not be missing out on too much.

EDIT:I didn't expect this post to blow up like this. I made it because I saw someone complain that they'd be more stable if their dad was there. I was like ""maybe, maybe not. Be happy with the life you have. Don't assume you're missing out.
If you have a good dad, I'm super jealous. That's one thing I'm intentionally aching to give my kids.
If you're a good dad congrats - I appreciate you even if you're not mine. You make the world a better place.
Thanks for the love and support guys. And if your dad or other parent hurt you or disappointed, try to be intentional about not being like them. The chances of being their copy are high.

Just alighted from the matatu from naivasha and asked a man for directions. He gave me directions and he started asking me for money. He actually demanded it. He started shouting saying I have his money and I am refusing to give him. I gave him 100ksh because I didn't like the attention. 

3days in and my phone was stolen. I went to the police and they asked me to pay 5k to track it. The phone itself cost 6k. Haha. 

I didn't give up and my aunt gave me some money to buy another phone. 

I was scammed out of money in eastleigh. 

I try to ask for directions from people, either they ignore me or are rude. 

I asked for a mat to go to kariorkor and the guy told me I had the right matatu. I paid 100 only to find out other people paid less. He didn't even take me to kariorkor. He took me to town. I took a motorbike and the guy demanded I give him 500. 

I have lived in naivasha most of my life and never been scammed. You can even walk at night with no problems. 

In short everyone in Nairobi seems to be out there for themselves. It seems like everyone is either trying to rob me or scam me..people don't even greet each other without wanting something.

15ctus5,Kenya,1690641393.0,"This goes out to the young men because I have zero perspective of the female experience. I know some of you are tired of the relationship posts, but I've noticed two fairly recent posts here of people speculating about whether someone they like fancies them or not. The short answer is no, they don't. 

I've not lived long, I'm 27. However, in my relatively short time in this earth, I've learned that if someone is actually interested in you, they will proactively show interest in spending time with you. If a person is not interested in you, they won't explicitly say no to you hence much of the confusion that our young lads are going through. The only time someone will explicitly say no is when you have pushed them to the edge by being too persistent, or if they were raised in a low context culture where direct, explicit communication is valued (I would believe Kenyans operate in a high context culture; [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-context_and_low-context_cultures)). 

Case in point.

You ask a girl out on a date, perhaps you tell her that you'd like to take her out for lunch or go for a common activity together and she tells you something along the lines of ""I'll let you know if I'll come"" ~~and she doesn't~~, ""I'm busy that day"", ""I'm not sure"" etc... all while **not** suggesting alternative (**definite**) dates, you for sure have your answer, that is her saying no without explicitly saying no. 

Alternatively, you ask someone out, then they explicitly say yes, or if they are unavailable, they suggest alternative timing then you are for sure spot on that this person is interested in you, this person is worth investing your time and resources into! Additionally, there is a certain ""vibe"" that someone who is interested in you will give off, you can sometimes sense the excitement that they are harbouring for you. They will literally fight to spend time and interact with you if given the chance. 

In conclusion. Anything that isn't a ""yes"" is a no and you would be best advised not to waste your time chasing someone who doesn't want to chase you. Secondly, leave extreme persistence for the movies. Sometimes it's for your own good that this person is not interested. You two might be incompatible, or the other person may simply be taken, and they are protecting their existing relationship. It's best just to take a no at face value and avoid hurting yourself in the long run.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/15ctus5/they_are_simply_not_that_into_you/,They are simply not that into you!,Relationships,171,61,0.99

Atheists! Stop congregating into large groups to discuss your atheism and congratulate each other on being intelligent little atheists. Wait, you've even written songs about your atheism? Trying a bit too hard there, aren't we?

You don't have to build huge monuments and buildings to declare your atheism to the world. You don't need loud gatherings that disturb all the people around you. FFS, stop shoving your atheism down our throats!

The door-to-door atheists are the worst if I'm being honest. Where do you get the nerve? To come to my doorstep while I'm trying to enjoy some time with my family and try to shove your atheism down my throat. Seriously? These atheists man! 

And what about those atheists who walk the streets with their non-believer holy book, yelling at everyone about their atheism, whether you want to hear it or not? Don't you just hate them?

I swear to God if I encounter another one of those atheist bus preachers I'm gonna lose it! I'm just trying to get to work my dude, I'm not trying to hear about the entire backstory of atheism and your experience with it

And those atheist politicians and government officials, I mean honestly, where do you get off preaching your atheism to the entire country? You're in office to serve the people not preach your atheism to them.

Atheist hotel owners, seriously! Why are you so preachy and presumptuous? Do you think everyone who sleeps at your hotels will be an atheist? So why do leave you your little atheist holy book in all the rooms? Are you trying to shove your atheism down my throat?

Even historically, atheists never shut up. Remember the atheist missionaries? They traveled around the globe shoving their atheism done the throats of other communities that weren't even interested, by force if need be.

And finally, have you ever visited an atheist's home? It's like a cult with these people. They have pictures of the first atheist hung up on their walls. Some of them even wear little atheist earrings and necklaces. We get it, bro, you're a fucking atheist! Can you shut up about it now?

sxy20r,Kenya,1645461960.0,"So, during the day today I noticed I didn't have enough cash to pay for my commute home from town and more importantly from home to town tomorrow morning. To my knowledge I knew I had a hundred bob note and 30 bob in coins. So I decided to withdraw 1000 bob from an mpesa (because lopha categorically refuse mpesa payments)

Because in the mornings kanges usually get asinine when you give them a 1000 bob note, I decided to pay with the 1000 bob and for good measure add the 30 bob so that I would get 950 bob change (fare is 80 bob to my destination). Anyway I pay and just chill and watch YouTube shorts knowing I'll get my change later. A short distance from my stage I remind the makanga to give me the balance......wacha jamaa aniruke. Ati, ""wewe mbuyu umelipa 80. Tunawajua sana wezi."" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This idiot not only was he refusing to give me change, he had just called me a thief. Me, a father of boys. A respected banker. Admin of several WhatsApp groups.

I felt holy indignation rising through my veins. I wouldn't let this guy get away with this as a matter of principle. My inner John Wick rose to surface and for a moment I forgot I was 40 and overweight and I was ready to go toe to toe with the inbred. Wacha ni pige kelele nikimwambia mimi si rika yake. Wacha tu escalate kesi kwa CEO wa gari, dere. Dere ako hapo ame changanyikiwa wondering who to believe. Eventually wisdom rained on the driver and on discerning that I'm a respectable member of society, and makangas penchant for their unchristian ways, he told the nincompoop to give me back the change.

Feeling vindicated, as I walked away, I gave the conductor and the semiconductors that had congregated to witness the spectacle, a look to suggest that they should choose better prey the next time.

I get home and as I am dissecting the events that had just happened, I put my hand in one of my pockets and the unmistakable texture of a crisp 1000 bob is felt. Intact.

Edit: After weeks, I finally met the makanga. I asked for his number, he was confused because I made sure I had paid the fare with the exact change, I sent him a thousand bob. He finally remembered me and told me the way that money had pained him. I apologized and explained my side of the story. Tukasema poa poa with that nod. Mambo ikaisha.

131tgrw,Kenya,1682691923.0,"How liberating is it to share your life story with strangers online?Thank you in advance for reading this. Y'all remember that Somali girl who ran away from home??? After her brother slutshamed her for wearing pants? That's me. A lot has happened since then. Shortly after I escaped, my mother showed up at my work place and I ended up being fired. In the Somali culture it is abhorrent for a woman to be on her own. My boss was related to my mom. It was a big drama and my mother cried in the boardroom telling me to come back home to which I refused. Rightfully so, I was tired of the physical and emotional abuse in that house. Home, the first place I ever wanted to ran away from. My colleague's sister accommodated me when I was jobless. Thank God for the savings I had, I never lacked anything.

 After 20 days, I got another job, opposite my former workplace and the pay was 10k higher. Bingo, things were falling in place for little ole me and I started securing a one bedroom house in Uthiru. I was happy, relieved that the bad times were behind me now. Manipulation and guilt trips from my mom never ceased but I never  budged This time my mother got pneumonia and begged me to come back home. She said if she dies it's my fault. I felt bad and went to visit. Never planned on moving back but didn't tell them upfront cause they won't hear it. Now, I smoked weed at that time, but they didn't know till my brother snooped a phone I used to use and found videos of me getting lit. This day, the day my whole world would fall apart, I had a blunt in my bag.My sister and I had a fight and my brother ganged up on me and beat me up. I was livid  and really hated my family for all the abuse subjected to me and went into a rage mode, breaking the dishes. The sorry excuse my mother birthed violently put me on the floor and held both of my hands firmly. I was stuck.  

My face was bleeding, I puked, couldn't move. My mom finds the blunt in my bag and she is hurling abuses at me. I hear her call my uncle to come with cops who arrest me and detain me in Pangani. The whole matter took a distasteful turn and I found myself sleeping on the cold hard floor using my shoe as a pillow, 3 days later, my mom comes and tells me to come back home. Big No from my side. She leaves me and a day later, they are back, I am discharged but I don't see my mother. The cops and my uncle. Writing about this makes feel sad and helpless. I am forced into a car and I was like where are you guys taking me? I hear the taxi driver being directed to Mama Fatuma road and I find myself in this 'rehabilitation centre' called Mustakim. I fought hard but I was overpowered. Five men forcefully dragged me to that hellhole and after I saw that fighting bore no fruits I surrendered. Since when is rehabilitation forced on someone? They are boys and girls locked up there for different reasons, mentally challenged, elderly, criminals hiding from the police.

 I realised I had seen that hellhole before. In a documentary titled as rehab nightmare. I spent 124 days there, 4 months. The food was shit, the girls were bullies. I was bullied and almost fell into depression. I am not a religious muslim and adapting there was hard. Covering up all the time. It was mandatory to attend Madrasa at 7am and throughout the day.Failure to do so you are beaten up. Cameras all over, electric fencing to deter escaping. Literally prison.  After I stood up to a bully,  the management intervened and the girls pinned it on me fearing the bullies. I was locked up in this very small, dark torture room called Room 10, the place everyone feared. I was chained, beaten and cold water poured on me many times. 

They were good times, where we sung and danced together despite our problems and differences,flirting with the boys chini ya maji since we are not allowed to talk.This one girl had been there for a year and four months. I've been discharged five days ago and freedom is strange. I am not allowed to leave the house. I lost my job, my house and my life. Now I feel dead inside. I've become a shell of my old self. I wonder how such an illicit place could exist, corruption is the answer, the cops are paid off by your family, the owner bribes Nacada. It is a well connected system.Someone was locked up because he married a non Somali. This guy, his wife committed suicide wondering where he disappeared to. Too much pain.  I reached out to Nacada and they don't care. Go watch Rehab nightmare on Bbc.

 It is so fucking hard talking to my family and interacting with them, I isolate myself and my mom says she feels sad seeing me like that. Newsflash! You did that to me. I feel pity for myself for being birthed by her. I wish I didn't exist. I just wanna shut that place down and I don't know how 
Thank you for reading all this.

rjrfwg,Kenya,1639897990.0,"The lengths  people are going to have weddings has me dumbfounded.My WhatsApp has been blowing up for the past few months, and I can say it's  the same for many of you, Wedding Harambee's is the name of the game. Look, I am not against weddings at all.. if someone wants to have a grand wedding, you should have it, however, have a good chunk of money to finance it, be financially woke as well. I recently had a conversation with a friend of mine who told me about a friend of her's who convinced the husband to take a 250,000 loan for their wedding, and rally people on WhatsApp to contribute the other 250,000. Mind you these are people who live pay cheque to pay cheque..DO YOU WANT A MARRIAGE OR A WEDDING?..The idea that people are willing to splash huge amounts of money for 'the glitz and glam, get-people-talking' type of wedding, yet they will be back to eating  ugali and skuma for the next year or two has me questioning ALOT!..There is alot I can do with 500,000k ,splashing it in one day! To please a bunch of people I haven't  met in years, is the absolute least of my concerns. Some of the guests will still talk sh*** btw..I am okay going to the DC or whatever they are called these days, and have a wedding that costs maybe  Ksh10,000 because I am honest enough  to say 'I CAN'T AFFORD A WEDDING' ..My mum  has been given a target of 5000Ksh for just one wedding that she is supposed to contribute to..She is just a primary school teacher who doesn't earn much money, with my siblings school fees to pay, and now she has a ton of weddings asking her to contribute, January is on the corner...But my mother has to contribute to 'X weds Y'. I get the idea that people want to celebrate their love and all but  they should be honest with themselves,  Can they afford it? It's the COVID era and not many people have the luxury to contribute money to weddings, it's  the blunt truth. My mum is the type of person who will contribute because she doesn't want to come out as the 'mama who didn't changa' and she represents many people who are struggling to make ends meet.PUT ME IN A WHATSAPP GROUP TO RAISE FUNDS  FOR A FUNERAL, MEDICAL BILL, EDUCATION FUND and others, I will sacrifice my heart, soul and money in a second, NOT A WEDDING, its not an emergency..If anyone wants people  to support their wedding, they should have at the very least ,70-80% of the money. If not, postpone  it or go to the DC..People are struggling out here, don't pile on them unnecessary bills, it's a culture that needs  to stop..I am pretty sure there are other CRAZY wedding stories!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/rjrfwg/wedding_harambeesif_you_cannot_afford_a/,"WEDDING HARAMBEE'S!..IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD A WEDDING,DON'T HAVE A WEDDING",,162,63,0.97

I have a mixed feelings because that kind of money is so much to fathom considering that my previous job paid me $100- 150/ month.

I don't want to mess up because I was brought up in poverty and I know what being at the bottom feels like. It was only last week that I went 3 days without food and now I am literally one of the best paid people in Kenya.

I want to invest and move to a bigger house (currently living in a bedsitter and still single). I want to change my lifestyle without going broke, I need some financial advices that worked for you.

I am a 27 year old guy and I don't have any dependants. I only have a little bro who's in high school that I'll be supporting. Also, both of my parents are dead so I don't have anyone else to be sending money monthly.

Which platform do you use to invest? What are the ROIs? 

Your input will be highly appreciated.

Majority said I break up with him and I was scared I had to. I was hoping more married people would contribute but that's not the population of the sub. 

I did see some people say I should talk to him. And I did. I didn't tell him I want to break up. I asked him what was wrong and if the foundation we're setting is good for a realistic relationship. 

He has been trying a lot. I just didn't know. He was ashamed of telling me the hustles he was doing because I make way more money. He has been paying a school fees debt and since I was offering to cater for the relationship financially he was comfortable and he apologised for that. 

He has lost weight. He is eating better but hasn't gotten to gym spirits but it's okay. 

He did say the sex thing he'll improve. He just doesn't have experience. And we've been working on that and it's 300 percent better. 

He just started a new 8 to 5. He's so much more alive. And still a very nice guy.

11rrzr4,Kenya,1678874668.0,"So in late January my dad committed suicide a few days after my birthday. He was always happy so everything happened so suddenly and it is hard to believe that happened. Anyway now that I look at you it my mum is also to blame. Fast forward my mum is a stay at home mum dad was the only breadwinner at home but everyday mum was always occupied with church stuff mara sijui chama........

Dad stopped going to church 2 years ago after the death of my sister ever since he started cutting people off and he would tell me how all this people I see around him aren't really his friends....he always stayed alone and he didn't associate with people. I didn't know what to tell him ju yeye cause he is older than me and plus I'm good not good at such stuff. He also used to tell me how he feels lonely at home cause my mum is usually not at home on Sundays and that is when my dad was free. So I used to go home almost every weekend so I can keep him company.

Then my uncles and aunties (his siblings) started having land issues and so he offered to cater for the land division etc ju he was a land surveyor they used to stress him out. And he had no one to talk to.  So fast forward to when he committed suicide.....

It was on a Friday he called me in the morning and asked me how school is I told him school is fine we talked for a while about how we would go take my sister to school for the form one admissions everything was fine when we talked. Until in the evening when I called him and my mum picks up my phone crying I asked her what is wrong and she told me that my dad was in hospital so I go home the next day and that's when I'm told what happened.....my dad died on Sunday.

I later found out that on that day at around midday he called everyone (apart from me) he was crying and even after all that nobody cared about where he was and what he was doing.......it hurts till this day but I understand why he did what he did  and now mentally I'm not okay I just wish I had someone to talk to",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/11rrzr4/my_dad_committed_suicide/,my dad committed suicide.......,Discussion,145,97,0.98

I don't know why but that just sounded very weird. I know they are not doing labels or anything but no one has the right to talk about a person that way. 

I also have a guy i have sex with but i will never reduce his whole existence as someone who gives me orgasm and makes me feel good and i will not go around talking about him as if he is a dildo.

The whole comment was uncalled for. He could have just replied ""i don't have a girlfriend but I am seeing someone casually ""  end of my rant.

r1jwos,Kenya,1637801766.0,"A Month ago I posted an article of how COVID lockdown aroused my creativity and I managed to brew the finest Muratina using todays science & technology while still using the traditional art of brewing if you never got a chance to read the article here is the link [https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/qca7j6/the\_art\_of\_tradtional\_crafted\_muratina\_using/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/qca7j6/the_art_of_tradtional_crafted_muratina_using/)

The last Muratina was aged for 6 months with 8% abv alcohol, I decided to go a little overboard  by distilling it, after several failed attempts and getting ***drunk on my own supplies*** I have nailed it down and  here are the results *drums rolling......* 

 allow me to introduce the first ever in the History of traditional Kikuyu brewing Muratina liquor at staggering **40% ABV**, finally! a clean traditional spirit for Kenyans,   I used a copper coil condenser for distillation, achieved **100 proof** alcohol then aged the liquor by soaking Muratina pods in the liquor for 6 months to create complex chemical reactions that occur between the distillate spirit and the Muratina  to produce aromatic flavors on the palate and achieve that golden brown color, spring water *(spring water has minerals which add smooth taste and enhanced flavors )*  was used to dilute the liquor to 80 proof 40% ABV 

the flavor is honey like balanced with a herbal taste of the Muratina

They don't even how deep I am in debt. I don't tell them coz they're financially strapped too. I've got siblings but wueh!! Life yao ni payday to payday so I avoid bugging them given it is hard for them to get by as it is plus zakayo is coming for their unimproved salaries 😂. I am about 200k in personal debt including unpaid rent but not including helb(78k). Very unemployed and in any case I get a gig, money goes to debt financing after food and airtime. FR my bills are those two only. Can't travel. Can't date. Sherehe ni ya kuitiwa with a signed affidavit that I am not paying for anything. Only entertainment is movies on the go. Avoiding dating is funny and hard because I am generally funny so I find myself in situationships haziishi. Basically I cheat emotionally 🥲😂. I have good loyal friends but they broke. I guess average income of my four friends is around 17k highest being 22k and it gets delayed AF. I could start a hustle but capital  ni tricky kupata while you're in debt so I stick to little online gigs that bring in like 7k a month.
It's bad for me economically but I can't say I am on the ledge. Depression has been having my back but I think I am at acceptance stage juu I feel happier of late. Landlord has been nice to me. He doesn't hassle me but has insisted on opening my door once I am only two months in debt but if it hits Jan 2024 he's gonna have to auction my two cents belongings. 
My situation has been brought about by my own financial mistakes. Majorly using debt to finance debt kama gava tu. 😂😂😂 I believe I am smart but hapo Kwa pesa mimi ni fala tu. Until last year august, I was making good money per month but I'd prioritize on the wrongs things. I'd make like 70k then save like one or two K. I like traveling so much of my money went to that. Once I started noticing cracks in my finances I'd think I'd have a financial breakthrough in no time but as soon elections came, then dollar did it's thing and life became more expensive zile cracks zikakuwa earthquakes. Momentarily after swearing in ya wsr markets started improving but life expenses went up so I started undertaking debts and in by Dec I had moved from a one bedroom to a bedsitter. I had to sell off some stuff juu ya space but I can't really tell you what I did with the money. One bad mistake you'd ever do is start selling your household goods for whatever reason yenye sio kureplace with new one or you have surplus juu you'll always get bad prices for the value they gave you ata kama they were old. Also it makes you view everything as money mazee utauza Hadi chakula. 😂😂😂

Wueh!! Ata nachoka kutype. I don't really think I am saying all this for online pity or paybills but more like to elimisha people. 

*Always have a budget. Mainly have a bare minimum budget of basics. Food, rent, water, electricity and transport. Hapo kwa food make a meal plan and stick with it. 
*Save in a sacco. KSH 50 per day is as good as a KSH 10000 a month.
* Loans are only good for well thought and planned investments ata kama ni kibanda. Omba ex wako pesa ya supper but usijaribu kukopa Tala pesa ya supper. 
* Avoid 30 day loans. 
*Invest in a good health cover. Mpesa app has that afya something tab incase private insurance is too expensive for you. 
* Have a lawyer. Ata kama ni beshte amefanya law. Let them know they are your go to people incase umeshikwa masaa mbaya or any unlawful arrest. Some of these things need lawyers sio thao mbili ya kukutoa. 
*Hii maneno ya kucutoff people every new year is BS you never know when you'll need your village. 
*Lipa family na  mabeshte  wako first. These are the people you'll need as witnesses Kwa biz deals na guarantors kwa bank and stuff.

I can only talk about this cause I've fully healed.Around 2018 I tried selling a PS4 Slim console on Jiji, for around Kes. 30,000/=

An Airtel number gives me a call claiming to be interested,me excited, knowing I'm gonna make a quick buck (I really was cash-strapped at the time) arranges a meeting.

The guy, who claimed to have a sick son at MP Shah Hosp. in Parklands and wanted to gift the boy this console, agreed we meet...In retrospect,he was full of red flags that I just didn't want to see.

So on the fateful day I take my ps4 slim,2 pads and FIFA 19, put them in a bag and leave for Parklands. I get near MP Shah,I call and call and call,no response. I'm now close to the hospital entrance I call again,no answer.

20 mins later this guy calls back, apparently he was in his sons ward but he's out now and in a White Toyota Premio and he's even seen me, he signals me,I go enter his ride (all holy car,small bible on the dash,crucifix hung on the rearview mirror, car stereo playing catholic songs)he checks the PS4 slim,and he likes it.

Now we have to leave the car and go to his ""office"" nearby so he can check if it powers on ""juu ashai conniwa hio Jiji akabuy ps4 yenye haiwaki""😂

Bro,he even encourages me to leave the bag inside the vehicle ""itakua tu safe"" I comply,we leave the car he carries the Ps4 and leads the way to like a mini shop complex near-by.

Here goes the cold water. There was an upstairs space in this complex that was supposed to be his office,my mans alikua anapanda stairs 4 ama 5 at a time.Sijui alinipotelea aje...Mimi kufika juu,hio place ni salon/cosmetics shop. A lady dusting the counter.

""Umeona mtu amebeba Ps4 na pad mbili ameingia hapa sahii?""

""Ps4 ni nini,hakuna mtu ameingia hapa,ndio tunafungua kazi""came the reply. 

My buttcrack is sweating.Im nauseated.

Nikarudi chini mbio (equally 5 stairs at a time) headed to where our Premio was parked,Premio ni wewe.Haiko.Im feeling like puking,knees are weak.Hata fare ilikua kwa ile bag yetu😂😂

Knees give in,I sit down on the gravel.watchman comes.""Kijana uko mgonjwa?"" Silence ""...Kijana...kijana unazuia watu ebu songa uketi kwa pavement!!""
Nimeibiwa.I meekly reply...

""Kuna Gari imetoka tu hapa sahii,amesema ako na emergency..."" Sweet baby Jesus!! I confirm my fears.Call the number...Mteja.

pon9ku,Kenya,1631700884.0,"Let’s not lie to ourselves. This country is a shithole. Bad governance, poor services and corruption is rife. Corruption is so ingrained into the Kenyan society I’m not even sure of the best way to solve that, if even possible. I blame one person, rather one family: the first family. 

In primary school we were taught that Jomo was a freedom fighter and the truth is that he was just a shitty shitty guy who Jaramogi let to be president just cause he was in good with ypipo. In power he shafted Jaramogi and stole half the country and shared with his fabled “kikuyu mafia” (responsible for several high profile killings including that of JM Kariuki)

He started this cronyism we see that is so rife in our country right now. Kenya is not a meritocracy and it has never been. 

Years down the line his son has outdone his father in terms of plunder. This country has gone to the dogs. To the point he can brazenly claim on live tv that 2 billion disappears everyday. Can you imagine? You wake up everyday at 6am. Enter a shitty matatu that is unroadworthy, go to the unsafest part of Nairobi, CBD. If you survive pickpockets on your way to the stage, big up yourself. You go work at a shitty office with a shitty boss and earn a shitty salary. Then go back to CBD, walk like you’re in a walk race so as not to attract muggers then you finally get home. 
At the end of the day, 30% is taken from your hard earned money so you can get “services”. 
Our roads are shitty, our healthcare system is non existent among other terrible things. 


I tell my family these things but they’re “uthamakis”. They do not see it as the premier’s fault. They think he just hired the wrong people. Lol 
They call me brainwashed by my Nairobi friends. Because I speak against him. They say if Uhuru says jump they ask how high. I’m always angry at family gatherings because I’m very political. And I find it hard to keep shit to myself. Wish we could unlearn tribal politics by the flick of a wrist. But alas. We have a long way to go.

He says “incase it happens”, a good wife should protect the hubby and act like nothing happened, incase someone intervenes.

uuhpzl,Kenya,1653116320.0,"So, this is just my own opinion from my own perspective and experience. 

Do not have a wedding that you cannot afford! About six years ago at the ripe age of 27, my college sweetheart and I decided to tie the knot. She was two years younger than me and from a slightly better off family than mine. 

The total budget for our wedding was ksh 1,118,000 (lumping in dowry and the wedding. I paid 200k for dowry, so wedding was about 918,000). I also raised 400,000 from savings (my entire savings actually), took a loan of 300,000 and received 300,000 from the contributions of family (mostly hers) and friends. 

I won't go into so many details, but paying off that 300k while also handling domestic financial responsibilities took a major toll on me. I no longer had any money for leisure or my personal projects. This in turn took a strain on the marriage and we divorced 3 years ago, we have one child with whom we share custody and I feel like I let him down the most in all of this. I won't blame just the wedding for the failure of our marriage as there were many other factors and issues with compatibility involved, but the cost and subsequent debt contributed heavily to the failure of this marriage.

As an old-ish buck to a young one, you have nothing to prove to anybody. You don't need to have a big expensive wedding and never take on debt to have a wedding. Have a ceremony within your means and ensure your financial freedom. Learn from my mistakes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/uuhpzl/weddings/,Weddings,,134,111,1.0

14k6jqk,Kenya,1687850413.0,"I have seen someone sharing their short stay experience in the US I have enjoyed reading through that thread, here is my experience of China (North) for 4yrs . I specify north because life/ culture/language/ weather is very different from the southern parts of china. If anyone has been to china even for a short stay lets hear your experience. 
Long post alert ! 

Edit : Years !

1. Efficiency in the transport sector is by far the most impressive part about China in my opinion.  Its so easy to get from point A to B having the options of a wide subway network, buses, cheap taxis(safe), bicycles trains and bullet trains. There are lanes for cyclists/motorcycles as well and they are cheap to buy if want yours. Bus/ train fares are so cheap. Mtu hajui kichinku ata struggle koz you have to know names of where you are going and to read maps . 

2  Safety.  In my 4 yr stay I have never lost anything to pick pockets nor  have  I ever seen one. We would ride bicycles 2 am in the night and enjoy the breeze during summer its so safe . Mahali umesahau kitu utaipata hapo the next day. Infact ukiibiwa kitu just know its your fellow kenyan that has taken it. Taxis are extremely safe. When it comes to any sort of crime sikuwai experience ama kuskia. 

3.Since I speak the language fluently, I experienced the hospitality and chinese culture in a deep way . I have never been mishandled by a chinese person even if I ask for directions they are very helpful and (most) of them take it as an honor to have foreign friends they want to take you out all the time , buy food and stuff for you.   Note that this is not the case everywhere some cities where africans are in big numbers or even less have chinese extremists or just ignorant and uninformed chinese that hate/ ostracize black people,In the city I stayed foreigners are few so wachinku huko welcome foreigners but if you cant speak the language definitely it will be hard to get by they will shy off attending to you even in shops. 

4. Kushikashikwa nywele na kuulizwa if our braids are real of fake hair. Long stairs by chinese people ata kwa subway unaangaliwa hadi mtu anakosa kushuka stage yake ndio tu akuone and they dont fear they make eye contact  . Wengine wanakataa kukaa na wewe kwa basi ndio wakuwe na angle ya kukucheki fiti. Ile inaudhi they take photos of you without asking and I mean literally every where. Alafu few think an african can read and understand their language wanakusengenya and I confront them when I hear something insulting/ racist. Most times I used to pretend siskii lugha ndio wasianze kuuliza the common questions to foreigners: which country are you from, how old are you, how many people are in your family, do you have a boyfriend, do you wash your hair daily, how many hours is the flight from your country to china etc. 

5. Cheap stuff everywhere electronics are cheap, clothes are cheap ( except in malls akina zara etc) , utilities and renting an apartment is cheap (except city centre) my 3 bedroom  ( kilimani chinese style  apartments) cost me ksh 21kes monthly so tulikuwa mastude tunashare 3 people kila mtu analipa 7k. We used to cost share on bills though stima was the most expensive during winter other than that hatukuteseka . Machakula tunabuy kwa soko they are cheap. Things online are cheap and delivery services are very efficient.  I literally survived on food delivery services esp during winter when u dont want to go out or cook. 

6. Its good to note that I was on scholarship so life was fairly easy for me as compared to self sponsored na watu wenye waku huko ku hussle . Chinese have a racist aspect where they don't think blacks know anything or can speak English.  Most jobs there go to whites and light skinned people.  I used to teach English as a side hussle but you have to prove yourself. My chinese language skills kinda helped me negotiate my way through but still huko they prefer whites for jobs. They are also obsessed with mzungu English accents. People lucky enough to work in international schools are reaping big. 


7. I enjoyed Church and the community there of foreigners those years church was not so restricted and regulated.  There were lots of activities to keep things interesting and fun.
For the sake of watu wa sherehe,  the nightlife in china is lit and I mean lit ! West africans are in large numbers huko and they know how to party most are employed in clubs as djs or mc/ hypemen etc. Wakenya mkikutana in one place mkiwa wengi (rarely in the city I was) it was always so much fun. 

8. Dating life . My fren thats another kanairo watu wanabadilishana watu huko like underwear. ( foreigners to foreigners) Especially in a small town where everyone knows everyone 

9. Chinese are pathetic , when it comes to hygiene.  Clothes are so cheap huko but mchinku atavaa nguo 1 month without changing. They have a habit of spitting kikohozi every where and they make that sound. They belch loudly and hardly take showers during winter. (The older men mostly). Also because of their diet midomo zao hunuka , their bodies also have terrible odours. Their bathrooms clog because of hair shedding. The population of old people there is alot . Families have one kid wao hushtuka nikiwaambia my family is comprised of 
6.

10. Last but not least all Google products are censored in China. You cant use fb, Instagram whatsapp etc without a vpn na sometimes vpn zinasumbua depending on the phone you have. Hakuna google maps unatumia maps ya huko . Search engines unatumia za huko but info is so limited since the government has censored outside world news and especially from the US. Even movies zikitokea if kuna inappropriate parts they cut them out hawana sex culture huko. Wale watu wakunyonga wanateseka since all blue content is completely censored ofcourse with the exception of a reliable vpn . Kama wewe ni mtu wa weed or hard drugs you will suffer since you wont find that stuff anywhere in china unless you are deep state. I never saw any of that huko lakini sigara ni kwa wingi na pombe na bei ni ya jioni.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/14k6jqk/4_yeas_in_china/,4 Yeas in China,Adventure ,132,56,0.99

After 15 months of playing a Master distiller in my crib (undisclosed location) thanks to covid lockdown I have managed to craft four types of alcoholic drinks courtesy of this powerful traditional plant called MURATINA harvested from the slopes of Kieni, Nyeri County 

introducing The Muratina Family, the finest traditional drink using today's science and technology 

1. **Muratina shine/vodka** x3 distilled 40% abv 
2. **Muratina Oak** 40% abv (rested in oak barrel for 8 weeks )
3. **Muratina original** 8% abv
4. The first Crafted **Muratina beer** made with Hops, Barley Malt, spring water, and Muratina herb 4.7% abv kegged and refrigerated to keep it fresh, crispy and chilled (my favorite)  

I will be launching Muratina Beer and Muratina original at my friend's wedding in August with an intent to go into full production the legit way 

Sasa tunaomba serkal itusaidie kupata liquor license bila ya kutoa hongo, I know is a tedious process filled with a bunch of bureaucracy but once they sample these drinks they will change their minds and speed up the process

Currently living with a friend and even though she's not complaining, I feel bad being a burden to her. Would like to move out but I have nowhere to go - no siblings or relatives to host me.

1413erx,Kenya,1685942760.0,"I was a content writer for the last 2.5 years. Nonstop work. Suddenly Google won't penalize AI-generated content, clients vanished. I was writing articles almost every single day. It's how I survived covid. Now I'm down to 1 article per week if I'm lucky, and it's not funny. I never once used AI in my work, and I don't intend to. Writing original content is easier (and more fun) than fixing what a machine blurts out. 

I'd appreciate any leads for more writing or editing/proofreading work, doesn't have to be SEO. Yes, I'm applying to other platforms but they're taking their time. I'm guessing they can't hire writers if they can't find clients. 

TIA.

Edit: Mmekam through, thanks to all of you. The ideas so far:

- Niwache kichwa ngumu and use AI to my advantage
- Learn new skills and change with the times
- Create content for a profitable niche
- Check Fiverr for leads
- Try forex and crypto
- Tafuta sponsor (wasee kuweni serious sometimes)

I'll update as you continue to chanua me.

Edit 2: You guys have combed me niiiiicely. Asanteni. More things I've learned:

- Change is a weird thing. Kuna wenye wako in denial (kama mimi hehe), na wenye wamegive up, na wenye wanasonga nayo. I guess this is normal, ni mtu ajue kwenye ako. 

- Kuna wenye walikula pesa ya online jobs wakatuchomea picha. If you're over there saying, ""Waone sasa vile wanalia,"" please remember hatuko wote the same, in fact most likely hatujuani. Wenye wanajua vile hii job hukuanga ngumu tunajinyamazia tu. 

- This AI thing iko na terms and conditions. Kuna vile you must shikanisha different tools until they make sense. For me who knows only writing, AI is a complete upskilling process. 

- There's no kuomoka chap chap with the way things are going. If any of us try the advice here, tujipee time kabla mambo zipick at least tuone tushilingi. 

I won't be able to reply to each person, but if you can keep sharing your wisdom kuna mwenye atafaidika.

Watu wa jaba stories this is not for you ..

I came as a Kemboi, nilipata makaratasi after a certain time, ilibidi nivalishe MTU sipendi Pete.

So, ukikuja in the name of chini ya maji, people will take advantage of you., My 1st job I was cleaning at a Kenyan truck company they were paying 800 bob an hour for 9hr, and second job 7hrs for 900 bob..224k monthly. Pesa kidogo Sana.

With your salary, you can't afford housing, most Kenyans are on 3 jobs ama mnaishi kama wa Nigeria, 8 people in a 2 bedroom. It's a struggle. You're also dodging immigration, we have cops that stop buses and check documents. Or they raid areas where mostly illegals live, pia Kenyans will sell you out.

Some of us a lucky tulipata paper work. I've met people who came in the 90s Hana hata karatasi moja.

Kemboi huku, wengi live on the streets.  Especially those who come and don't have relatives. Kuna MTU mahali hupata Tupesa anabahatika anapata agent, because ameambiwa majuu kuna jobs they come and end up homeless.. Ukiwa homeless you can't get any job. You have to get a sleeping sections.. mnaingia by 6 leave by 7. Huko they will steal even yo shoes.

Many many Kenyans and Nigerians are homelessness. Coming home ni shameful, ulienda majuu unarudi nil. Sometimes unapata host, ukifika Kwa ground they switch off their phones..so you need to have a solid line when you arrive.

Coming to US is not hard, survival is the problem.  

Bila papers you can't own anything. Most things uko nazo zitakuwa under someone else. Kikiumana , they can retain your things and it happens a lot. MTU amerudi Kenya unaskia alikuwa majuu na ni mlevu utapata alioshwa manyumba na magari, sasa Hana kitu.

If you can apply for a greencard. The process is easier and better, they cater for a lot of things , getting a job is better, you can do jobs za $20/70hr .

So don't fall for the pictures people post, ati anadrive rangerover.  That's among the cheapest cars huku used. You can get one na 200k, gari zingine hata 60k ziko safi.. and have custom plates with your name.  Streets are cleaner so hata ukipiga picha kwa slum it looks better than Kilimani. 

Before you come be ready for loneliness, Struggles that will beat you down like nobodies business, the cold is extreme, kama uko na shida za kifua, you will deport yourself.  Huku health care is expensive asf. You can spend 100k on simple things like a tonsil infection. Kama uko na shida shida za mwili reconsider coming..

Wale mmepata greencards furahi, wale kembois jitayarishe. Experiences ni tofauti Sana. Will answer your questions.. this is mine.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/13pg105/diaspora_struggles/,Diaspora Struggles,Discussion,127,150,0.99

I understand it but it’s really hurtful to short men who don’t get to choose what height to be born at. Also society has normalized it, such that if a girl says she doesn’t like a guy cause he’s short it’s considered understandable.

Continued chatting on phone several days after the walk and we agreed I visit his place one Friday evening to smoke a joint together. Am not a smoker but it was out of curiosity to feel the high that people gush about.

So one good Friday evening nikajituma kwake, carrying a big bag of popcorns which he had said he likes(was taught by mom hufai kwenda Kwa wenyewe mikono tupu). The guy immediately informs me yeye alikua amenunua food na amekula yote so he hopes I have eaten too. Well, I had eaten like 2 hrs earlier. Anyway,sawa jamaa, let's smoke the weed basi, si hio ndio imenileta?

So we smoke the joint na ikanishika kwelikweli. Started feeling thirsty (atleast maji ilikua), hungry( minyoo zijipange) and quite disoriented. Well, sex was had(though I informed him that I didn't think I was in the right headspace for it). I don't know if it's the weed or what, but I felt like sex went for too long and unfortunately weed didn't make me horny. Man, I just wanted to sleep. Then asubuhi jamaa akanilambisha glucose, literally, like aliniekea kaglucose Kwa mkono nilambe🤣🤣🤣, then he sindikizad me kwa stage. 

Yes,you can call me easy for the lack of control for that night, but am already mad at myself. I didn't talk to the guy much after that, though he kept sending ""hi, how are you"" messages and generally trying to keep in contact. Then after some time he sends me a message that he wants to hang out. In my mind I was like....hang out? Like keep me hungry, f*ck me and unilambishe glucose?☠️☠️.... Ffs, just leave me alone. Well, I politely declined his offer.

1) The pickpocketer, yani pinji/mtu wa kusanya, the guy in possession of your property will quickly go to your control panel & put your phone in Airplane-mode then he will shut down your IPhone. Wewe utastruggle hapo kucall simu yako lakini wapi...

2) Mr Pickpocketer/Mr Pinji/ Mr Msanyanji, will now do everything in his power to get as far away from the vicinity as possible, usually as far as the next County...

3) The following day, after sleeping off his fantamargogeous Heist, Mr. Pickpocketer will quickly find a Brocker & sell them the  phone at a stupidly cheap price, usually at around 1000 kshs. why? because stealing iphones is 1 thing but Overriding the ICLOUD LOCK is another, An Iphone with an ICLOUD LOCK is like carrying around an expensive brick. Very useless to Mr. Pickpocketer.

4) Now the phone is in the hands of  Mr. Brocker, These brockers are usually people who own stores that sell refurbished IPhones pale CBD or employees of such stores. Now Mr. Brocker, since he is a business man he needs to make back the 1000shs he spent on buying your IPhone from Mr. Pickpocketer right? He Has 2 options. 1) Sell the Parts of the IPhone abroad usually in Asia, price is roughly 50 - 100$. 2) Try & Get your Apple ID & Password in order to override The ICOLUD LOCK & then sell the IPhone at Retail price of 1300$ and make 100% profit.

5) Mr Broker will usually opt for option number 2, lazima wapate maximum returns just like any other business man. This is where the PHISHING EXPEDITION starts. 

6) Mr. Brocker will usually wait roughly 2 months before kicking off the PHISHING EXPEDITION. because at this time, unakuanga ushaa kubali simu imeenda hivo & most IPhone owners will put the phone in Lost Mode. Lost Mode is when you LOG into FindMyIphone in another device & put the lost phone in LOSTMODE which usually locks the phone further and displays a message on the screen saying 'This Iphone Is Lost Please Contact This number' 

7) Now step 1 of the Phishing Expedition involves Mr.Brocker going to a very remote area of the country where he will turn on the IPhone in order to see the LOSTMODE screen so that he can get your contact information. he will then switch the phone off and leave the remote area because the location of your Iphone will have been pinged on FINDMYIPHONE.

8) After he has gotten your contact info, ataenda kwa bedsitter yake pale Thika and that's when the number that you put in LOSTMODE will start receiving messages from 'Apple' claiming that your iphone 14 PRO MAX 512 GB GOLD has been located & you need to click this 'link' in order to view the location. Most Kenyans are gullible and they will click this link, the link will require you  to put in your Apple ID & Password & BOOM! that's how you loose your IPhone FOREVER.

9) Wewe ukiwa katika harakati za kuweka password yako in order to 'Locate' your Lost IPhone, Mr. Broker is on the same terminal on another device watching everything you're doing & after he gets your Apple ID & Password, he will reset your IPhone, take it to his shop & sell it as a new phone & make good money.

* Lack self-respect
* Have no commitment
* Have difficulty maintaining relationships
* High risk of contracting or spreading STI's

Now my SO has never had a serious job nor been fully responsible in paying bills such as rent and school fees. I have also caught him several times flirting with girls on social media to which he's not doing anything wrong because he's not meeting them physically. A few years when this happened, we had a break-up but he ended up hospitalized and I had to take him back. He vowed that he wouldn't do that again.

A few months ago, July to be precise, I caught him flirting with a specific girl. He said that he's sorry and hasn't been been doing anything physical with her, just chatting. I got very mad because I thought he had stopped that behavior. Funny enough, the gal in questing was requesting for some money and he had agreed to send. Mind you he hasn't been paying our family bills. I asked for a break-up and he's been postponing citing that he's not stable to rent. On my side I don't want to live with him anymore and I get extremely mad every time I see him in the house. Its my own property so I can't move. I need advice on the next step to take since I'm on my wits end.

v4k4dl,Kenya,1654329394.0,"Let me explain. Global loneliness rates among young people us going up. This is especially true for men, who have a harder time than women forming communities. Locally, Covid made things worse and the economy makes things worser. Bc now we can go out and engage in fun activities and partake in hobbies but we don't have the money.So we stay in, buy bundles and watch movies, maybe log into whatsapp once in a while.

Now,one can realistically have multiple friends but only one girlfriend  (for the most part). So, it doesn't make sense that every woman they meet they instantly hit on? Statistically, does it not make sense to offer friendship up first, and if it organically blossoms into something romantic, good for you, and if it doesn't, you still have a friend in your repertoire?

Because you could hit on someone and if they are not interested you have lost yourself a  potential friend and maybe future partner both in one fell swoop.

Maybe I'm just frustrated because in one week, one man started sending intimate texts within 3 days of meeting, another solicited sex within an hour of inviting himself over and making poor one sided conversation and yet another made a good conversation awkward with innuendos when we both know I've seen his SO bring him food multiple times.

There's something expensive we lose, especially in today's world, when you sheer bonds prematurely by introducing sexual/romantic subtext. Bc now, though we share interests, i no longer feel comfortable in these men's presence and they won't meet my eyes in the corridors any longer. And for what?

That 30 minute sex you think you want with an essential stranger won't fill the void. I know it, idk how y'all don't. And, as per multiple studies, sex is better with someone you know too, so y'all aren't even being devious enough to play the long game smh.

Was on a bus to Nairobi and a guy opened the window the whole way. I could see everybody was uncomfortable with the cold but no one said a thing. People wore extra clothes. He like opened it the whole way and wind was literally coming into our bus. 

Another time while waiting for ID, a lady was there vomiting profusely and was very sick. Nobody even spoke to her. She had to take herself to the hospital alone. 

Another time while opening an account at equity, the bank teller kept shouting at us. We were like 25 adults. Nobody said a thing. And we didn't do anything. For hours while waiting.

Some other time an Asian guy was insulting us at Naivas supermarket in broken English while waiting on line. Nobody said a thing. Even the watchmen. He apparently didn't want anyone close to him.

163ntvh,Kenya,1693233414.0,"Leapfrogging refers to the phenomenon where emerging economies or societies adopt advanced technologies or systems without first having to go through the intermediate stages that more developed nations experience. 

For example, Kenya leapfrogging from landline telephones to mobile phones- increasing access to millions without the need for the government to invest in the expensive traditional landline infrastructure. While this was certainly a good thing, Kenya missed an opportunity to influence city and town planning because landline infrastructure supports auxiliary services such as internet connectivity. 

A more current example is the adoption of AI tools such as Grammarly and ChatGTP which provide communication assistance, especially for non-native English speakers. This has the potential to discourage language skill development, something that we may see in the near future.

These two examples show that leapfrogging has the potential to drive economic growth and development in poor countries but has the risk of people skipping important steps in the path to progress.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/163ntvh/the_hidden_side_effects_of_leapfrogging/,The hidden side effects of leapfrogging,Discussion,113,92,0.99

He never got back to the levels he used to though. My sister is a writer and she's been making more than him. Earlier this year, he wanted to be the manager of her funds as well but my sister refused to let him. Nonetheless, whenever he needed money, he would always take it from her and she had no qualms. My sister told me that she was even taking the whole family out with her money from time to time.
Turns out, this was the cause of breakup. The guy felt that my siz has been disrespectful to him and nonsubmissive. When I asked his friends an example of the disrespectful behavior from my sister, he laughed and told me that my sister has been taking up his responsibilities like taking the family out and such. Then he went ahead and explained the state of mind of the guy and why he viewed all that as disrespectful.

There are myths and facts about fuel saving but most drivers dwell on myths more than facts.

Here are simple steps that any driver can follow and end up saving fuel by 85%.

-Before you start your engine, make sure you check on your engine oil and coolant levels.

-Start your car engine let it run for atleast 30 seconds to allow oil to circulate.

-As it runs check on the tyre pressure and make sure they are good.

-After the 30 seconds switch off  your car engine.

-Lock the doors, and walk to work.

-Repeat this every day until you have enough money for fuel.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/pp3k9k/how_to_save_your_fuel_by_85_when_you_dont_have/,HOW TO SAVE YOUR FUEL BY 85% WHEN YOU DONT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY,Humour,113,27,0.97

14jlwl8,Kenya,1687796808.0,"In the spirit of posting topics other than politics, s*x and relationships, wacha I share my experiences so far in the US. I am visiting friends and relatives in Ohio and Georgia. 

1. Everything is big over here, I now understand why obesity is such a big problem. For every family I have visited, there is a humongous fridge full of food. Plus big cups and big bowls and plates. Na fridge za US si kama za Kenya, ni kubwa. Na bado unaona watu wakipika.

2. Decided to attend a Kenyan local community church as I thought since they are here they would hold more diverse views. Welp, regretted it immediately and reminded me why I left church in the first place, Christians can be the most bigoted and intolerant people out there. And they were fundraising to build a church in some slums, felt like telling then Kenyan slums have the most churches and it's probably a scam. 


3. Everyone seems shocked when I tell them I am going back to Kenya. With the exception of GC holders and students, it seems majority of Kenyans came here as visitors and just never went back. So they get surprised when they see a visitor who is not planning to stay. But the love for the motherland is real, most Kenyans seems are here to hustle and plan to go home at some point. 


4. US kuna watu wazee kabisa, wazee yaani 90s and 110 years olds. Had a chance to visit an adult home care and honestly it was extremely depressing to see those tumzees living their sunset years hapo. No family to visit them, wako tu hapo. Makes me really appreciate the togetherness we have as Kenyans and we love and support our cucu's and gukas


5. Mass consumption is ingrained here, people buy, buy, buy, buy stuff all the times. So people's houses are full of stuff. The variety also makes it easier for people to buy buy buy. American marketing it seems is the best in the world,these guys have mastered the art of subliminal marketing. Offers, sales, BOGOFs, etc can make you go broke very easily.

Over the past 4 months i've been working on building a small tool to track my previous KPLC electricity transactions. Felt that the current self service portal really wasn't sufficient to do the same.   
So i built [stima.app](https://stima.app) that does a subjectively better job in showing giving you more info on your prepaid / postpaid transactions.  
For more on the how the core part of the platform works check out [this blog post](https://davidamunga.com/blog/b1ba269b-8b37-4203-b85a-e917ae47a495)  
The app is free forever and was built as a hobby educational project with no intended commercial use in plan. Only Subscription data (name ,email , meterNo) optionally provided by the user is stored for the purpose of sending a monthly roundup email. All queries made to get past transactions are not cached in a database. You can check out more on how it was built in a recent [blog post](https://davidamunga.com/blog/0a3dee5b-de91-49a8-84c4-7f2cb0faca6c).

If keeping track of your past bills resonates with you, then give stima app a try :)

xeknp5,Kenya,1663208968.0,"Hi guys. My neighbour's maid knocked at my door yesterday so hard I thought the building was burning.
She asked me if we have a smart tv to which I replied no. She ran away only to come back a few minutes later. She asked me to help her with their tv. 

I went there reluctantly because her boss is a very rude and mean woman. She wasn't there. She gave me the remote and asked me to delete the tv search history on YouTube. I was curious to know why. 

I was shocked to find that she had searched:

Sexy sexy,  
Phonography,. 
Man and woman sexy sexy,. 
Indian sexy sexy. 

I think she was trying to search for porn and I felt extremely awkward. She tried to explain to me that the children sometimes search for ""bad things"" .

I told her that the children are too young to do that. She said that sometimes the tv acts up and she doesn't know how it happened. Anyway I tried and after sometime I delete all the search history. 

Then she told me she had a problem with her neon ray. I could tell it was new. She asked me to ""wipe everything"" on the phone. I said ok and wanted to reset the phone. After confirming if she knew the email and password, she brought a paper where the information was written. I figured that maybe she wanted to delete her search history on chrome and YouTube. 

I was curious and looked at what she had searched and saw the same theme. She was trying to look for xxx videos without success. The farthest she has ever gone is those clickbait romantic videos on YouTube. Like how bad can someone be at looking up porn on the internet. They are literally billions of such videos 😂😂😂.

Anyway I cleared her search history on YouTube and chrome and gave her back the phone. She took some time looking at the phone. I am assuming she was looking at the history and after a minute I saw her smiling. She asked me how I was able to get her contacts back if I wiped everything on the phone. I bragged that I know such staff.

I didn't reset the phone because with neon rays you can only use the email registered after the phone was bought. Also the email password she gave me was incorrect. I couldn't go into recovering the password at that moment. 

Anyway I feel bad for her. I have a lot of porn in my phone. Should I just ask to send her some. She could lose her job if her employer sees the search history on YouTube in the tv.

Ikakuwa an issue cause they were hiding behind the excuse of ""African time"" but I had to stand my ground, and eventually cancelled the meet. 

This isn't an isolated case. Growing up my parents were pretty strict about punctuality, which is why I always arrive on or before time, and if I can't I'll communicate beforehand that I'll be running late. But it's something quite pervasive that you find someone showing up half an hour or an hour late to a scheduled meeting with zero communication and no apologies. Same happens for events as well. An event is scheduled for 9:00 but actually starts at 11:30. It's strange to me how comfortable so many people are with just having a casual disregard for others' schedules.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/15qln95/african_time/,African Time,Discussion,105,112,0.99

sdtb26,Kenya,1643270499.0,"Yeah, the title's correct.
I met this nice lady around this time last year. A few conversations and we were soon in a relationship. From our talks back then, one thing I liked about her was her ambition, her drive. Yaani she knew what she wanted in life and was specific about it. Fast forward to about four months ago, she moved in with one of her friends who has a 'loaded' boyfriend. I don't know exactly what they talked but soon later we had a conversation where she told me her friends wonder about her boyfriend because he doesn't spend on her and that means he's spending elsewhere,huh! That hit me hard btw.
Concurrently, she started being distance. Our daily talks started going cold. We'd talk daily and it was fuuun, then it started being a two minute call, just small talk. ""how was your day, blah blah blah"". I soon founded a startup and started getting some more cash flow, I started sending some salon money, coz you know, you gotta take care of your girl, mmnh.

I took a day to look back and the change all started when her friend/friends put the idea that her boyfriend should take care of her needs. She has a job btw, and far from the capital. She would become 'loving' around when I send her money and then go back. She'd then always find excuses to avoid meeting me.

Long story short, it all started to revolve around money and I don't think my job as a boyfriend is to be the financer of my girl. I'm okay with a little now and then but ikikua inafanya you despise me, it's not good. Red flag 🚩


Kesho niko single. A birthday to remember


EDIT: It happened:

I'd asked her to call me and I was to tell her what's on my mind, but she ended up hanging up on me after telling her how she's indecisive on what she wants out of the relationship. That was the last thing we talked about. I met her after attending a cousin's event and this cousin knew about our relationship, so when she'd asked a while ago, I was unable to hide it from her. She's married and really good at giving advice but this made her really sick. So she posted a pic of me on her WhatsApp status and this drove her nuts.

Anyway, I believe breakups over text are not alright but I had to do it that way, she hung u already. She later talked to a mutual friend, admitted we had problems, but couldn't say them to him. Asking whether we tried to solve them, she couldn't answer too. I've tried to meet my former gf like three times a week and I couldn't. Not something someone who loves you would do. 
This thing that I thought I'd do and get over with turns out it's deep guys. I feel a gaping hole bana. I mean I'd planned to do this, yes, but still, there's something that's gone. Dunno how long it's gonna take to get over it but I got hope that it's gonna be soon.
Well, it was a day with mixed feelings. Happy for turning a year, yet another chapter closed. Life, right?

I appreciate all the good messages... and I'm a bit sad that this trend is rampant out here. I hope we all get people who reciprocate our vibe, really.

She says that her baby daddy is a deadbeat who doesn’t provide and is generally out of their lives. She had her own apartment (and still does) but has likely stopped paying rent there. She hasn’t confirmed if she’ll be living there beyond April. 

Her living with me has been great as she has been taking care of the house (cooking, cleaning, shopping) while I buy groceries and pay all bills. 

She’s also been emotionally supportive and has brought good vibes ever since I met her. We only had one incident of miscommunication where she walked away but came back a week later. 


I want to have a discussion with her this weekend of where our relationship is headed to. I’d prefer one where she takes control of her son’s needs (health, education, entertainment), while I provide for what’s needed in the house (rent, bills, food etc).

I've already told my parents and other siblings that I'm kicking him out but they are asking me to be tolerant with him. Of course they can say that because they are not the ones who have to put up with his BS.We've all tried to intervene, we asked him how we can help but he said he doesn't need help, we paid for therapy, rehab because he seems to be dependent on weed (anyone who can give insight on the side effects of weed please help). We even got him a sure job in IT which is what he studied but he refused it. I don't know what else to do. I have two older siblings but they live abroad so there's not much they can do.

We have become very close and talk (and video chat) on a daily basis. She has been asking me to come for awhile and I have recently applied for and received eVisa to travel there, but am having some reservations and am seeking advice from knowledgeable citizens/residents.

She does not come across like a professional sugar baby/escort besides the fact she initially claimed she is specifically interested in white/foreign men (red flag #2?). But she never asks for money or anything material despite being essentially unemployed and a single mother. She lives with family so this is where I am assuming all of her support comes from. I have chatted with her family and they seem great which has really made me more comfortable about everything.

The really hopeful part of me wants to pursue a long term relationship and possibly marriage with her. She is very attractive, kind and I have grown to like her a lot. However, my big fear is I will get there and discover things are not what they seem. Everything seems very real and genuine now, but I know the economic realities of her situation can make people deceitful out of necessity.

Basically, I would be happy to spend the time and money to bring her to the US if we were to be together. Actually, I am happy to fund her life entirely if we were to marry. But the fear I am having is that as soon as the ink dries on her ""papers"" she is going to hit the door if it ever came to this. I have seen this expressed in this sub on several occasions.

15bu4rj,Kenya,1690541742.0,"Men who have been in this situation with a woman they pursued, how do you deal with this?

Backstory:

I(24M) met this girl through a mutual friend(her cousin) earlier in the year. We instantly clicked. She understood my jokes and we flirted a lot. I didn't wanna rush things though because I also didn't want to scare her off. I still didn't take my foot off the gas and made it clear that I liked her and I thought she did too. We trained together and I want you to picture those gym videos where you think *well those two are definitely a couple* because my hands often lost their way around her body and found themselves in some dangerous regions.

So I finally made my move after 3 months and asked her to come to my place. Lo and behold, she says ""No"". This came as a shock because rarely in my life have I ever been so wrong about matters of the heart. She said she *wasn't ready to leave her mum's place ata kama ako forty.(She's 23).* She also refused to see me for when I asked her to at least come and talk to me f2f. I decided to cut contact with her.

Fast forward a month later, I meet her with another guy. This dude lives around 10 min to my right while the girl lives around 10 min to my left. He is an acquaintance since we play Fifa together and the mfucker has beaten me like 90% of our games and sometimes he volunteers to pay for some games even though he lost. He has even held small tournaments at his place so I have been to his house.

I didn't know the two were an item until I saw them later on that night past 11pm while I was at the balcony. She was in his arms like a little kid. Nilishikwa na kizunguzungu and a certain wave of jealousy that I've never felt before. The other guy lives in a better apartment than me, he's tall, brown, has short dreads and he is the typical *sweatpants with sandals dude.* On paper, I cannot compete with this dude and I can't get it out of my mind partly because the girl who was prepared to stay home till she's 40 doesn't seem too keen on that anymore.

I met her once near the dude's place while she wanted to go in and the awkward look that we gave each other bana, I hate feeling like that. Anytime I meet the dude while playing Fifa nowadays I play with a lot of feelings and I end up losing even more. I can't start a random fight with him because he's a genuinely nice guy.

&#x200B;

Seriously, how do I move on from this situation?

>!Diversion: Apparently the mutual friend(her cousin) who introduced us had a thing for me but I didn't like her like that. I don't now if I was rejected because of this.

I researched this because I saw someone suggesting that he should be the president of Kenya. Personally I think he is far from qualified to be one.

He is a self serving grifter and hypocrite. You can't keep saying Africa needs ""liberation"" while at the same time, you are dining with those who are responsible for the dismal conditions of the continent. 

He also doesn't miss a chance to b**tlick the current government in place in exchange for freebies. His purpoted ""Pan-Africanism"" is just a smokescreen to hoodwink NPCs and low information types.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/153rvu5/plo_lumumba/,PLO Lumumba,Politics,106,122,0.93

170flos,Kenya,1696505557.0,"Today, as I lie on my back, gazing at the ceiling, tears start rolling down my cheeks. Deep emotions engulf my mind. What I can see around looks almost surreal. How did I get to this point? I can remember the day as if it was yesterday, a day that changed the trajectory of my life forever.

Fifteen years ago, while helping my mother on the farm, we received an unexpected visitor. It was the local administrator, a sight that usually spelled trouble for a teenager like me. But not this time. He greeted us warmly and handed over an envelope – what I now call the envelope of hope. For the first time, I was addressed as Mr. The letter inside read, ""We wish to congratulate you for your performance in the just-concluded Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE). We would like to extend our hand and help you pursue your education.""

I broke into tears after what seemed like a bleak future suddenly turned bright. A thick veil of darkness was lifted from my eyes, and I whispered to myself, ""Finally, the light at the end of the tunnel is starting to shine."" I received an almost-full scholarship from the Kigumo Education Endowment Fund by Jamleck Kamau to undertake my secondary education at Kerugoya Boys High School.

On the reporting day, I had a resolve burning within me: to prove that I deserved the scholarship. But things didn't go as planned. During the first term, I performed dismally, shattering my expectations. It felt like I was slipping into an endless abyss of despair. Determined not to let this setback define me, I resolved to give it my best shot the second time around.

The subsequent terms were a rollercoaster of emotions. From bad to worse, I felt like I didn't deserve the scholarship that had given me so much hope. Yet, I pushed through the challenges, hoping against hope that things would get better. And they did. From the first term of form 2 to form 4, I can hardly recall a time I went below a B+ in my performance.

In 2012, it was time for the national exams. Despite the challenges, I gave it my all. I managed an A- but couldn't help but think I could have done better if not for the strikes that rocked our school that year. To add to the pressure, I was the school captain, and this took a toll on me emotionally. However, the scholarship sponsor agreed to support my tertiary education, leading me to Kenyatta University.

The university years were tough, but they were also where my love story began. In my second year, I met a beautiful woman, and before long, we were dating. Seven years down the line, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, we celebrated our union in a humble COVID-19 wedding. Today, we are blessed with a one-year-old baby boy.

After college, I ventured into entrepreneurship, but my first attempt failed miserably, pushing me to the brink of giving up. However, I persevered and eventually landed a contractual data entry job. Yet fate had other plans; I only lasted for five months before quitting, determined to focus on entrepreneurship again, armed with the lessons from my previous failure.

But success didn't come overnight. Despite my best efforts, my second business attempt faced a similar fate. I found myself back in the cycle of job hunting. I secured a job in my field of study, finance, but it became evident that formal employment wasn't my path. Within three months, I made the difficult decision to quit, knowing that my true calling lay elsewhere.

I started anew as a content writer, accepting any opportunity that came my way, even if it paid as little as $0.5 per 100 words. The struggle was real, but I refused to give up. I immersed myself in self-education, taking courses in digital marketing, SEO, content writing, and keyword research from various platforms.

Through relentless determination and continuous learning, I started attracting better clients who recognized my skills and dedication. Some even invested heavily in my growth journey. Today, I find myself working with two prominent digital marketing firms as a content writer and editor. If you had told me this could happen five years ago, I would have dismissed you as a serial liar.

As I reflect on my journey, I can hardly hold back my tears. The trials and tribulations, the moments of despair and hope, all led me to this point. Each obstacle, each setback, and every tear shed became stepping stones toward my dreams. Today, I stand tall, not defined by my past failures but shaped by my unwavering perseverance and the belief that no dream is too big to achieve.

So, as I lie here, tears streaming down my face, I am overwhelmed by gratitude for the journey that brought me to this moment. I have become a living testament to the power of resilience, determination, and self-belief. The tears I shed now are not of sorrow but of overwhelming joy, for I have emerged stronger, wiser, and victorious against all odds.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/170flos/my_story_what_do_you_think/,My Story: what do you think?,Hobbies ,105,36,0.98

Majority of Americans are poor. Living paycheck to paycheck while working multiple jobs. The movies are fictional. In reality you will see homeless people everywhere, hear gun shots on a regular basis, and deal with rude people on a daily. You need to make over $100,000 to make a decent living here, and that can and most likely will take a decade. The average pay in Humble City is $40000(after taxes $31000). Rent over a year will be $12000, insurance on a vehicle $120+ a month, car payment $400, food $600 a month. Not including health insurance etc. you will be left with $100. Unless you live with family! If you live in a big city expect to work 2-3 part time/full time jobs. 

If you do come here, the best option is to work 3-5 years on a semi-truck, save 60% or more of your salary and come back to Kenya, even if that means living in the truck. The lifestyle in the states can be summed up in one word: work.

1108yni,Kenya,1676183063.0,"r/Kenya just crossed 93k subscribers today. The growth has been unprecedented, there was a time we had only 30k subs while r/Nigeria had 70k and we have officially passed them in subscriber count. 

If you look at subreddits such as r/SouthAfrica, their subscriber count is larger but the engagement with posts is lower compared to r/Kenya. It seems that the recent passing of AKA has been talked about more on r/Kenya than on r/SouthAfrica. 

Why does r/Kenya do so well? 3 words; Variety of Topics. 

People here can post about Kenya’s beauty, relationships, their career struggles, an addiction they’re battling, politics, travel etc. 

Another thing is getting advice here is super easy. Posts here get multiple comments in less than 10mins. 

It’s one thing to get advice from another subreddit from someone in America, but a fellow Kenyan will have more context and might be able to give better advice on relationships, addiction, vacation, family etc. 

Also people can have discussions and have their views challenged about various topics. I for one have changed my opinions on certain issues after other Redditors challenged my thinking. This is what makes r/Kenya vibrant.

Take a look at r/southafrica, no offense to them but 80% of their posts is pictures of the country, their electricity issues and ANC. I wouldn’t subscribe there to be honest. 

r/Kenya is like a multitude of subreddits of various topics in one, but with a Kenyan touch. I believe soon we will pass r/southafrica. 

Mods, please don’t force r/Kenya to turn into one of those subreddits where people only post pictures of giraffes and lions. Allow various topics to be shared and opinions to be challenged (of course this must be done respectfully, politely and in good faith)

Anyways, looking forward to having more Kenyans on here. Other nationalities welcome too! 100k subs here we come 🚀🚀🇰🇪🇰🇪",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1108yni/why_rkenya_beats_other_country_specific/,Why r/Kenya beats other country specific subreddits in engagement and growth,Discussion,103,37,0.93

What you need to know

\-Orientation and introduction to the program will be free(2 weeks)

\- virtual and recorded two days a week, 1 hour per lesson, usiku classes no daytime classes

\-Program duration: 3 months. You should be competent enough by December to apply for a junior developer position.

\-Program commitment fee 4000 per month or a lump sum of 12,000 (this is very cheap and to make up for my time; I've learned the hard way that people don't appreciate free things). Plus, go check the rates out there, starting with Moringa School.

\-The program is recommended for high school graduates, university students, working-class house wives/husbands 😂 

\-I can only handle 10–20 students at a time.

I was about to call off the date and accuse her of catfishing me with make up, but the gentleman in me subdued this and persuaded me to look beyond her physical appearance, to look at her heart 🥲

Lo and behold even her heart was a catfish. We had earlier discussed that we would meet just for drinks (but at a posh place) and enjoy the ambience but things took a turn for the worse..

Madam ordered a meal instead of just drinks, and also proceeded to order drinks 😂 her total came at 3,000. I ordered my stuff and the total for both of us was around 4,500. 

I wasn’t prepared to spend such money that day, I was irritated all through the entire date. 

Worst thing is, she only ate half her food and said she was full 🤦🏾‍♂️😖 I was fuming 😡 but again the gentleman in me allowed the date to go along and even got her an Uber home at the end of the date. In total I must have spent 6k on that single date, with a make up catfish. 

But I ghosted her from then henceforth despite strong nudges by the gentleman in me to respond to her “Why are you not talking anymore” texts. I learnt my lesson.

m75lic,Kenya,1616001907.0,"1. Many boarding high schools operate within strict schedules.. The one I was in was no different.. We jad lessons from 5AM to 8:50PM and then go to sleep at 10PM.. Ka uko form four ni 11PM... All these hours spent on convering 8subjects... Honestly, this is poor time manage.. In countries like US where students can take waay advanced classes and even college credit, they dont have as hard time as kenyan students do.. And yet.. After all the hours soent burried in ‘books’.. Most high school gradutes, if not all, dont end up developing essential skills needed to compete in the real world.

2. COMPUTER STUDIES IS THE MOST WASTEFUL SUBJECT EVER IN HS.. Ata heri ufanye bizna ama kitu ka hio.. Why?.. A high school student who takes computer studies for all four years of high school, will graduate without knowing anything about CODING.. we have reached the point where its very essential for someone to know coding.. Programming is a really essential part of tech( the most essential if I may say).. Na bado a whole HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM doesnt have anything about programming.. Mnafunzwa binary code tu... THIS CRIPPLES KENYAN STUDENTS.. Because globally, many high school students know how to code by the time they graduate high school.. Do you know how weird it is to say you did computer studies during your whole high school period and yet have no experience in programming.. If that is not a huge indicator of how kenyan students are being wasted by the system.. I dont know what is..


3. LACK OF SEX EDUCATION.. Like the only oart where sex is basically taught is in biology form three.. Of which , students aren’t really taught about how to use condoms or about different kinds of birth control with their risks and benefifs.. Watoto hawafunzwi what to do when sexual assault happens or even how to take care of their genitalia.. Like honestly with soending more of your life in school, you’d think yhe education system would care enough but wueehh..


4. THE PLAIN DISREGARD OF STUDENTS’ MENTAL HEALTH.. Honestly, ka ulisurvive 844... Mseh congrats to you.. Its hard.. With the abusive teachers and the hel toxic environment... Huko shule ukimention ati depression.. Unaonekana ka rich kid ama mseh akona maringo.. Yet depression is a huge problem that affects a number of hugh school students.. Why are schools so ignorant?


5. THE LACK OF CAREER GUIDANCE AND ADVISING... Honestly, only rich kids have the chance to get career guidance facilities.. Otherwise.. Inakuanga the same old same old.. Ukipata A - med ama engineering.. Otherwise, ni wer na Mungu wako na pesa za wazazi wako.. THIS IS WRONG.. very wrong.. Not every A student wants yo do medicine.. Kwanza hii narrative ya ati Med ni ya A students is very very toxic... Pia, kuna soo many other options that ate left unsaid and hence.. Everyone ends up choosing the same fee courses na ka hauna the grades or the money.. Unatipiliwa na system..



6.The 844 system only benefits the wealthy and the ‘bright students’.. If you dont fall into any, ur pretty much done.. Sadly.. eg.. In a very popular local public uni.. Unapata course ka CS .. Ikona ~46 govt sponsored students ( who got A and A-) alafu around 80 parallel students.. This shows that more space is reserved for those who can afford to pay.. Same for med and the rest..


Is this right?

Lets not forget to mention the lack of talent development happening in schools... Like so much talent gets wasted in 844 schools

kt4ciz,Kenya,1610118774.0,"**EDIT/DISCLAIMER:  25/03/2020:** I did  not expect this post to gain so much traction until i saw it referenced on several Tweets almost as if it's a guide of some sort. A few people have also reached out to me explaining that they've had a very bad experience with imailKenya.

This post was simply an honest review of my experience with them. It's clear that the  quality of service has since deteriorated. I'll urge all who stumble on this post/review to understand that the post was based on my experience and should not be used as the ultimate source of truth. Many have shared how their packages have been delayed for weeks with no communication or timelines. **I personally will no longer be shipping with them and would advice against using them until or unless you have evidence that the service has improved.**

Rule of thumb is before shipping try to scour the interwebs for the latest reviews on a particular shipping service before using it.

ION: As of today Savostore have revised their terms and have gone back to the Minimum of 1kg ($15) condition.

==

Queries on shipping are some of the most common questions on this sub. I had been shipping for 3 yrs using Savostore until i decided to try something else. Here is my experience:

Savostore was king of shipping until they revised their rates. A Twitter thread by angry Savostore clients that discussed the changes pointed out several alternatives. I randomly picked one to try out: iMail Kenya [https://imailkenya.co.ke/](https://imailkenya.co.ke/)

Since i had never heard of them before i decided to ship an inexpensive item; something i wouldn't bother following up on if it got lost. On 27 Nov, i ordered a book on Amazon worth $54.40, shipping was free, tax was $4.09 (US tax, not Kenyan), total $58.59. I used the shipping address that iMail Kenya provided, you ship to their warehouse in Fargo, North Dakota. My book was delivered to their warehouse on Dec 6. On Dec 9, they acknowledged receipt via SMS, they also took a photo of my package and posted it on my imail Kenya account(they have some sort of ticketing system/platform (freshdesk) that you access by signing up an account with them). On Dec 10, they provided a tracking number that one can use to track a package on their website ([https://imailkenya.co.ke/](https://imailkenya.co.ke/)).

On Dec 13, my package shipped from US. Package arrived in Kenya on 21St Dec and took about a week to clear through customs (remember we had 2 holidays 25/26). It was finally delivered to their warehouse in Eastleigh on 28TH Dec, at this point the package was ready for collection. On 29TH i received an invoice of KES 2984.90. They charge $13.80 per kg. The total weight of my package was 1.9kg.

**Pros compared to other popular shipping companies:**

1. Their website does not have the best design but everything you need is on the homepage. With some shipping companies getting the US address/rates/timelines is a pain, either you register an account or you have to navigate deeper into the site(looking at you Kentex cargo). Their rates are also shown on the homepage, everything you need to know before making up your mind is right there on the homepage and accessible without creating an account, signing up for a newsletter or some other BS.
2. The fact that they take a photo of your package and share it with you is a nice touch. It may look like a cheap gimmick but it helps in overall transparency. In case your package gets lost its unlikely that they'll resort to the popular excuse of ""we did not receive your package""
3. You get to track your package from US to KE. Most shipping agents don't provide this service.
4. Timelines are close to what is advertised (within two weeks), note that this is from the date of shipment to KE, not from the date they receive your package. Since they ship on Mondays (with a cutoff time of Sunday), if they receive your package on Monday, it will remain on hold until the next shipping date (next Monday) meaning it will now take upto 3 weeks for package to get to Kenya.
5. No hidden charges.

**CONS.**

1. Even though they respond to emails and Whatsapp i found their communication to be a bit disjointed. They have working emails and Whatsapp but on some occasions when you message them they respond by saying they'll relay your message to ""the Kenyan team"" yet the whatsapp number is Kenyan and the email is .co.ke. They need to synchronize communication between their US and Kenya teams to cut down on the loops one has to go through before getting the desired response.
2. Once your package arrives in Kenya they are slow at organizing last mile delivery by local courier to your destination. They are also not eager to communicate next steps (something that Savostore was good at). I figured that since i had paid all the fees, they had nothing to gain from me and my package was no longer a priority. I understand the Kenyan business culture where once umelipa kila kitu you are on your own; all communication, follow up and customer service stops. Even though i had indicated the need to have the package shipped to my place by G4S no response was forthcoming. I eventually had to go and pick the package from their warehouse in Eastleigh.

**Will i use them again?**

YES. Another order is already on the way.

**Any tips.**

1. Always try and take advantage of economies of scale. Shipping a $9 item makes no sense when the shipping fee is $13.80. If you have smaller purchases try and consolidate them into one.

 At the age of 10 i decided that i will be different, this is after i won a baking competition and my uncle told me that i should keep learning to bake so as to please my future husband. I never baked again till recently at the age of 22.

My parents left Somalia and sarted from scratch in kenya. I was lucky that i was never born in Somalia because life there is crazy from what i hear, i finished high school went to university and graduated started my bachelor's,  bought my first land , became the first woman in my family who did not get pregnant at the age of 17, the first woman who graduated from uni. I did it all whilst taking care of my mothers six children plus her oldest son my father.

My mother sat me down yesterday and said that there was a marriage proposal for me, from a man in America he is also Somali, he is 34 and has one foot in the grave, a truck driver but just because he has an American passport he is a hot commodity in the marriage market, i politely declined and it begun when am i planning to get married? never, don't you want kids?no, are you going to be a virgin for the rest of your life? yes. 

Long story short my mother has given me 2 years to find a man or she will do it for me. I don't want to be a typical Somali woman, who has 10 kids and stays at home, complines about her husband while he impregnates teenagers in Somalia in the name of Islam.

 Alot of people in my family don't seem to understand my uncle looked at me and said ""just because you have an education you think you are better than everyone"". He told my mother that she did me a disservice by educating me.

Also, at least put some effort into your posts and communicate your age and gender in your posts.

1617rif,Kenya,1692989584.0,"This is a disgusting tale. Reader discretion is advised. Grammar hapana tambua.

I will never eat mutura in Nairobi. Never, ever.

I had to spent Sunday night in Kikuyu town due to work related reasons.

One thing I noticed is there are millions upon millions of vibandas that sell mutura, ulimi (tongue), liver, chicken feet, and goat and cow hearts - anything in a living animal is sold and eaten.

Being a mutura enthusiast, I visited a joint and bought one whole mutura that I ate on the spot, as supper. I bought another roll ‘ya kubeba’ (take away). I finished eating my supper, picked up the take away and left to look for lodging for the night. After getting a room, to avoid going bad, I unwrapped the mutura and put it in the wardrobe to await breakfast.

In the morning, I woke up early, took a shower, and warmed the mutura which I ate as breakfast.

Kikuyu is one of the indigenous towns in Kiambu County that grew from the settlement of the colonialist missionaries and the presence of a rail Station. I therefore decided I would use the train to commute to town to beat the hellish traffic on Waiyaki Way. A quick online search showed that as per the KRC schedule, the train should leave the station at 5.40. I was at the station at 5.30 a.m.

The train, colloquially known as the Lunatic Express or the Lunatic Line, innocently sat on its tracks with its enormous engine running. I thought the fog made it look beautiful, inviting, calm, and quiet.

KRC were in for a rude shock.

At exactly 5.40, the train coughed several times, and then jerked forward. The journey had started. It glided on its track slowly and left the station.

I slowly drifted into a nap.  
Suddenly I was awoken by a rumbling tummy. My tummy. I immediately thought, Fuck! Mutura!

My tummy was rumbling repeatedly. The train was past Riruta as it slowed down to a stop in Ng’ando to pick more passangers. Ngando is a village along Ngong road (behind racecourse), a slum by Nairobi standards. At this point, most of the seats were taken so other passengers had to ride while standing. The train passed under ngong road, across into a clearing (I think behind the Army cemetery) where it stopped for more passengers.

My tummy was getting worse.

Then I felt like farting.

(I know that farting is disgusting but I have no alternative. For that, I apologise.)

I slightly raised one of my butt cheeks and released one long fart, slowly to avoid an avalanche of farts.

“Ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss.” Went my a$$hole 

Next to me, on my left, sat a pregnant woman. She was very pregnant. Very very f@cking pregnant. If we had a pageant for pregnancy, she would be Miss Universe – Pregnant.

Luckily (for her), the fart was odourless

The train went on.

At this point, more farts lined up like billiard balls. I released one after the other. Preggo asked,

“are you comfortable? Nimekufinya? You are moving a lot.”

“Niko sawa madam, thanks” I said.

Then she slept.

The ticketing lady passed by us as she collected our fares and gave us tickets.

I painfully held in the next fifteen farts. Yes, I was counting. Fifteen.

Number 16 could not be contained, however much I tried. I tried to hold it in but it felt like I was giving birth to it. It came out forcefully so I bent at an angle and released a long shushing one,

Ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

Preggo was awakened by the smell.

’’Hiyo ni sewage? Nachukia harufu ya sewage sana’’ she told me.

“Pia mimi” I answered.

“Fungua dirisha tafadhali’’

She looked around, most probably looking for somewhere to spit. I almost laughed when she bitterly and disgustingly swallowed the whole litre of spit. The standing passengers were looking upwards, trying to escape the fumes lakini wapi? Hewa ni ile ile. To make matters worse, half the windows could not open.

They too concluded there was a burst sewage nearby.

We approached Kibera as the fart fumes cleared and the train stopped.

At the Kibera stop, more passengers got in. Hundreds of men and women crammed into the train. For over five minutes the train stopped as more people got in.

As the train started moving, I unleashed no.17.

Number 17 smelt horrible. I gagged. Preggo opened her eyes, wide, tears filled her eyes,

‘’Kwani hii sewage inatufuata?” She shouted.

“Ayayayayayaaaaa Fungua milango na dirisha” I shouted louder.

‘’Uuuwi’’ One lady screamed,

“That is not a sewage idiot, Huyo ni mtu amenyamba!” A huge (Luhya) man told his neighbour.

“Huyo ameoza” a scrawny boy with a funny haircut said.

The train stops twice in Kibera, I think we were now approaching Ngummo when fart number 18 knocked.

Same ritual - bend at an angle raise my butt and release.

At this point, the train was so full hadi the ticketing woman could not manoeuvre through easily. She had to push through like a rugby player. Anyone who was short had nowhere to face except look up.

Number 18’s smell caught me off-guard. It smelt even more horrible. A mixture of battery acid, rotten mutura, raw sewage, and a dead cat all mixed up and blended then poured into a basin full of fresh human waste.

I had to complain.

“Tena amenyamba” I was angry!

Preggo almost lost it, she tried to stand up as she visibly retched, she tried pushing people so that she could puke, but the train was too stuffed. There was no space.

She had to swallow the vomit.

Eeew! Disgusting bitch! How dare she? Who raised her? Dumb BITCH.

The train was so packed that most of the standing passengers could not move their hands and just took in the smell like real men. Like real men going for circumcision with their noses, to me, looking like scrotums. They twisted their noses east west south and north. I think they helped clear the air faster.

Farts are contagious. I am no scientist but I now believe farts are contagious

Three minutes had not passed when passengers started complaining and screaming, again. Someone (else) had farted!

Ladies and gentlemen, we have competition!

It smelt of rotten eggs.  
I admitted defeat.  
The fart brought tears to my eyes.  
I held my nose, almost suffocated. I realised closing my nose meant I open my mouth. Worse.

Preggo was crying, she could not breathe. I pitied her but I could not hold my laughter when she shouted, in a Luo accent,

“Nitazaa jameni” as she tried to stand up.

“kuna daktari hapa? Hii imenuka mbaya zaidi!!”

13sxos7,Kenya,1685161030.0,"A bit of a rant, sorry this is a long post.

I'm a 27-year-old guy and I've been dating a 25-year-old female for the past four years whom I met in university.

In the four years we have been together, I came to realise that the more I climbed the ranks, the more she would demand of me financially. I'm generally very frugal as this is how I was brought up, but now I feel like I'm financially suffocating and anything I do is not enough for her. 

When we first started out, I was earning 15k as an intern and living in a 4k bedsitter. I admit that I received financial support from my parents during this time, but after about a year in that company my salary got to 65k net, I also upgraded to a 12k 1b in wangige. Me and my girlfriend would use this money to go out on dates and I would pay her fare etc.. I would end up stranded with nearly nothing at the end of the month and I would need to fuliza a few days to the next paycheque. 

This year I was fortunate in January to get a much higher paying job in a bigger company (200k net with stock options, sign-on bonus of 100k, commission from projects and a retirement scheme). The pay is good but the work is demanding, I often find myself working late into the night. 

I bought a small car in March as I hate using matatu (300k golf mk4). Other than that I didn't make any changes to my lifestlye, I live in the same 12k house and I don't intend to move. I keep my expenses below 50k and save/invest the balance in MMFs, saccos and Bonds as I'm saving up to buy land and I also send my mum/small bro some money once in a while as mum is retired and small bro just got his first job. 

Where my girlfriend comes in now; Ever since I bought the car, she has become super demanding ""babe let's do a road trip to Naivasha"", ""Babe, Please buy me a TV"", ""Babe, my phone is shit, can you please buy me even an iphone 12"", ""Babe, I saw this nice house I want to move to, please help me with the deposit"", ""babe, I need new clothes"", ""Babe you need to move to a bigger apartment"", ""babe this babe that"", I'm getting sick of it! and whenever I refuse to comply, she gives me the silent treatment for days on end, insults me, refuses to come and hang out and even goes as far as telling me that I am replaceable. 

I have also explained to her severally what my financial goals are, but she does not want to listen to me, she always goes back to ""you are so stingy, you have so much money, but I never see any of it"" as an argument. she herself has a job (she gets 60k net) and I don't understand why my money is such a big fuss for her. I'm honestly getting tired of this shit and I know it may come off as harsh, but I'm ready to give her the boot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/13sxos7/money_in_a_relationship/,Money in a relationship,Relationships,100,244,0.93

Alafu when you are cuddling a skinny girl you can coil together like snakes which is much more cozy and intimate, and this makes up for the loss in cushiness. Then, skinny girls, in my experience, usually have bigger personalities. They have more sense of humour, wits, and some kind of their femininity just pours out of them. Everything they do, you just notice the femininity. I think this is why small girls with big boobs are so alluring to the male mind. Then when it come to the physical act of making love, mdeki inaingia kabisa which is just awesome. Now I understand why white guys like slim girls and why western beauty standard favour them.

He can shower on his own though,he also knows his way around operating phones and the TV (we didn't have to teach him cause he learns through observation). He also likes to play video games and he's better in them that I am. His speech is slow,only those of us who are used to him will understand what he says cause he doesn't use full sentences. I love him so much! He has his bad days and good days,on bad days he gets moody and throws tantrums for reasons best known to him. Growing up we noticed he had an exceptional  photographic memory in the sense that he could remember things to the finest detail, for example,he can remember  events that date up to 15 yrs ago,to the exact date and even time! Also, another one, he's good at calendar calculations  and can tell the exact day of the month 30th of Jan 2053 will be etc. Ofc he couldn't do the 844 school system,so he's been doing IGCSE until upto the time things were starting to become complex  and he couldn't grasp them,that was like  year 5. From then,he went to a special needs school,it was good in terms of him being able to socialise, because he loves people,but they weren't really engaged much in relation to each of their abilities. In 2020, the whole family was home,quarantining  and all,and we discovered his other most dominant ability which is music.
I always had a gut feeling that he loved music cause he's all time obsession has been classic105,and he knows almost all songs that are played there. So on his YouTube,those are all he listens to. However,sikujua  that this dude knows all the keys kwa piano and can play any song from memory. I almost cried.literallyyy! So we started private piano lessons for him and my only hope is that he goes really far with this. Lately he has been becoming more sensitive  to noise and is easily triggered,so ata church haendi  because of the noise as it will overstimulate  him. I did my research and found that he is actually  an Autistic  savant who is gifted in music,calendar and photographic memory. I feel like the number  of schools in kenya that make use of such individuals is worrying and it is so frustrating. I forgot to mention that he is very routined  and programs himself to do everything  at a specific  time and in a specific  order. Maybe you guys can tell me about interactions  you've had with such people who are abled  differently.
(Savant syndrome: is when people,particularly  those who have limited  brain abilities eg the Autistic and probably  those who have brain damage due to accidents, these people have access to specific parts of the brain that average people don't.)

The reason you're seeing what you think should be in other subs like r/relationships is because people want views, advice that relate to how it happens in Kenya. People want it in a Kenyan perspective. 

Like the experience of online dating (tinder etc) in Kenya is different from the one in Norway or developed countries. If you describe a problem people over there can't relate or they will give you an advice that doesn't work in Kenya.

It would have been better if r/Kenya could have been divided into sections but that's not possible. So all the posts about Kenyan politics, sports, dating, social relations, education, jobs, careers etc are in one place.

A sub about Kenya doesn't mean it's about the geographical features of Kenya or description of Kenya, or tourism or politics. It's about everything Kenya, how life is in Kenya, dating, politics, etc... everything.
